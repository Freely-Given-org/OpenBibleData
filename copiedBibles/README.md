# Copied Bibles

This folder contains copies of public domain or open-licenced Bible files that
are used to create the static web.

The files are copied here for convenience.
General, we would recommend that you don't copy these files any further
(because they might have become out of date)
but rather that if you want copies, you would get them from their original sources.
