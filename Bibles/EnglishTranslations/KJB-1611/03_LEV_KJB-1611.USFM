\v 3 And gather thou all the Congregation together vnto the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.
\v 4 And Moses did as the \nd LORD\nd* commanded him, & the assembly was gathered together vnto the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.
\v 5 And Moses saide vnto the Congregation, \x + \xo 8:5 \xt Exod. 29.4.\x*Th\add is\add* is the thing which the \nd LORD\nd* commanded to be done.

\v 29 And Moses tooke the brest, and waued it for a waue offering before the \nd LORD\nd*: For of the ramme of consecration it was Moses \x + \xo 8:29 \xt Exod. 29.26.\x*part, as the \nd LORD\nd* commanded Moses.

\v 6 And Moses said, This \add is\add* the thing which the \nd LORD\nd* commanded that ye should doe: and the glory of the \nd LORD\nd* shall appeare vnto you.
\v 7 And Moses said vnto Aaron, Goe vnto the Altar, and offer thy sinne offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thy selfe, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them, as the \nd LORD\nd* commanded.
\v 8 ¶ Aaron therefore went vnto the Altar, and slew the calfe of the sinne offering, which \add was\add* for himselfe.
\v 9 And the sonnes of Aaron brought the blood vnto him, and he dipt his finger in the blood, and put \add it\add* vpon the hornes of the Altar, and powred out the blood at the bottome of the Altar.

\v 12 And hee slew the burnt offering, and Aarons sonnes presented vnto him the blood, which he sprinckled round about vpon the Altar.
\v 13 And they presented the burnt offering vnto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt \add them\add* vpon the Altar.
\v 14 And he did wash the inwards, and the legs, and burnt \add them\add* vpon the burnt offering on the Altar.
\v 15 ¶ And he brought the peoples offering, and tooke the goat, which \add was\add* the sinne offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sinne, as the first.

\v 3 Then Moses said vnto Aaron, This \add is it\add* that the \nd LORD\nd* spake, saying, I will bee sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified: And Aaron held his peace.
\v 4 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan the sonnes of Uzziel, the vncle of Aaron, and said vnto them, Come neere, cary your brethren from before the Sanctuary, out of the campe.
\v 5 So they went neere, and caried them in their coats out of the campe, as Moses had said.
\v 6 And Moses said vnto Aaron, and vnto Eleazar and vnto Ithamar his sonnes, Uncouer not your heads, neither rend your clothes, lest you die, and lest wrath come vpon all the people: But let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewaile the burning which the \nd LORD\nd* hath kindled.
\v 7 And ye shal not goe out from the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, lest you die: for the anointing oyle of the \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* vpon you: and they did according to the word of Moses.

\v 18 ¶ The flesh also, in which, \add euen\add* in the skinne thereof was a bile, and is healed,

\v 34 And in the seuenth day the Priest shall looke on the skall: and behold, \add if\add* the skall \add be\add* not spread in the skin, nor be in sight deeper then the skin, then the Priest shall pronounce him cleane: and he shall wash his clothes, and be cleane.
\v 35 But if the skall spread much in the skinne after his cleansing,
\v 36 Then the Priest shall looke on him, and behold, if the skall be spread in the skinne, the Priest shall not seeke for yellow haire: he \add is\add* vncleane.
\v 37 But if the skall be in his sight at a stay, and \add that\add* there \add is\add* blacke haire growen vp therein: the skall is healed, he is cleane, and the Priest shall pronounce him cleane.
\v 38 ¶ If a man also or a woman haue in the skinne of their flesh bright spots, \add euen\add* white bright spots,
\v 39 Then the Priest shall looke: and behold, \add if\add* the bright spots in the skinne of their flesh \add bee\add* darkish white, it \add is\add* a freckled spot \add that\add* groweth in the skin: he \add is\add* cleane.

\v 41 And he that hath his haire fallen off from the part of his head toward his face, he \add is\add* forehead-bald: \add yet is\add* hee cleane.
\v 42 And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead a white reddish sore, it \add is\add* a leprosie sprung vp in his bald-head, or his bald forehead.
\v 43 Then the Priest shall looke vpon it: and beholde, \add if\add* the rising of the sore \add bee\add* white reddish in his balde head, or in his bald forehead, as the leprosie appeareth in the skinne of the flesh,

\v 50 And the Priest shall looke vpon the plague, and shut vp \add it that hath\add* the plague, seuen dayes.
\v 51 And he shall looke on the plague on the seuenth day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warpe, or in the woofe, or in a skin, \add or\add* in any worke that \add is\add* made of skinne, the plague \add is\add* a fretting leprosie; it is vncleane.

\v 57 And if it appeare still in the garment, either in the warpe, or in the woofe, or in any thing of skinne, it \add is\add* a spreading \add plague\add*, thou shalt burne that wherein the plague \add is\add*, with fire.
\v 58 And the garment, either warpe, or woofe, or whatsoeuer thing of skin it bee, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shalbe cleane.
\v 59 This \add is\add* the law of the plague of leprosie in a garment of woollen or linnen, either in the warpe, or woofe, or any thing of skinnes, to pronounce it cleane, or to pronounce it vncleane.

\v 2 And the \nd LORD\nd* sayd vnto Moses, Speake vnto Aaron thy brother, that hee \x + \xo 16:2 \xt Exod. 30.10. Heb. 9.7.\x*come not at all times in to the Holy \add place\add* within the Uaile, before the Mercy seat, which \add is\add* vpon the Arke, that hee die not: for I will appeare in the cloud vpon the Mercy seat.

\v 6 And Aaron shall offer his bullocke of the sinne offering, which \add is\add* for himselfe, and \x + \xo 16:6 \xt Hebr. 9.7.\x*make an atonement for himselfe, and for his house.

\v 10 But the goat on which the lot fell to be the Scape goate, shalbe presented aliue before the \nd LORD\nd*, to make an atonement with him, \add and\add* to let him goe for a Scape goate into the wildernesse.
\v 11 And Aaron shal bring the bullocke of the sinne offering, which \add is\add* for himselfe, and shall make an atonement for himselfe, and for his house, and shal kill the bullocke of the sinne offering which \add is\add* for himselfe.
\v 12 And he shall take a censer full of burning coales of fire from off the Altar before the \nd LORD\nd*, and his handes full of sweet incense beaten small, and bring \add it\add* within the vaile.
\v 13 And he shall put the incense vpon the fire before the \nd LORD\nd*, that the cloud of the incense may couer the mercie seate that \add is\add* vpon the testimonie, that he die not.

\v 16 And he shall make an atonement for the holy \add place\add*, because of the vncleannesse of the children of Israel, and because of their transgressions in all their sinnes: and so shall hee doe for the Tabernacle of the Congregation that \f + \fr 16:16 \ft Heb. dwelleth.\f*remaineth among them, in the middest of their vncleannesse.

\v 27 And the bullocke \add for\add* the sinne offering, and the goat \add for\add* the sin offering, whose blood was brought in, to make atonement in the holy \add place\add*, shall \add one\add* cary foorth \x + \xo 16:27 \xt Leuit. 6.30.

\v 49 Either his vncle, or his vncles sonne may redeeme him, or \add any\add* that is nigh of kinne vnto him, of his family, may redeeme him: or if he be able, hee may redeeme himselfe.
\v 50 And he shall reckon with him that bought him, from the yeere that he was sold to him, vnto the yeere of Iubile, and the price of his sale shalbe according vnto the number of yeeres, according to the time of an hired seruant shall it be with him.
\v 51 If \add there be\add* yet many yeeres behinde, according vnto them hee shall giue againe the price of his redemption, out of the money that hee was bought for.
\v 52 And if there remaine but few yeeres vnto the yeere of Iubile, then he shall count with him, \add and\add* according vnto his yeeres shall he giue him againe the price of his redemption.
\v 53 \add And\add* as a yeerely hired seruant shall he be with him: \add and the other\add* shall not rule with rigour ouer him in thy sight.

\v 25 And I will bring a sword vpon you, that shall auenge the quarell of \add my\add* couenant: and when yee are gathered together within your cities, I wil send the pestilence among you, and ye shalbe deliuered into the hand of the enemie.
\v 26 \add And\add* when I haue broken the staffe of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one ouen, and they shall deliuer \add you\add* your bread againe by weight: and ye shall eate, and not bee satisfied.
\v 27 And if ye wil not for all this hearken vnto me, but walke contrary vnto mee,
\v 28 Then I wil walke contrary vnto you also in fury, and I, euen I will chastise you seuen times for your sinnes.
\v 29 \x + \xo 26:29 \xt Deut. 28.53.\x*And ye shal eate the flesh of your sonnes, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eate.
\v 30 And I will destroy your high places, and \x + \xo 26:30 \xt 2.Chro. 34.7.\x*cut downe your images, and cast your carkeises vpon the carkeises of your idoles, and my soule shall abhorre you.
\v 31 And I wil make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries vnto desolation, and I will not smell the sauour of your sweet odours.
\v 32 And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies which dwel therein, shall be astonished at it.
\v 33 And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.
\v 34 Then shall the lande enioy her Sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and yee \add be\add* in your enemies land, \add euen\add* then shall the land rest, and enioy her Sabbaths.
\v 35 As long as it lieth desolate, it shall rest: because it did not rest in your Sabbaths, when ye dwelt vpon it.
\v 36 And vpon them that are left \add aliue\add* of you, I will send a faintnesse into their hearts in the lands of their enemies, and the sound of a \f + \fr 26:36 \ft Heb. driuen.\f*shaken leafe shall chase them, and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword: and they shall fall, when none pursueth.
\v 37 And they shall fall one vpon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and yee shall haue no power to stand before your enemies.
\v 38 And yee shall perish among the Heathen, and the land of your enemies shall eate you vp.
\v 39 And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquitie in your enemies lands, and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
\v 40 If they shall confesse the iniquitie of their fathers, with their trespasse which they trespassed against me, and that also they haue walked contrary vnto me:
\v 41 And \add that\add* I also haue walked contrary vnto them, and haue brought them into the land of their enemies: if then their vncircumcised hearts bee humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquitie:
\v 42 Then will I remember my couenant with Iacob, and also my couenant with Isaac, and also my couenant with Abraham will I remember, and I will remember the land.
\v 43 The land also shalbe left of them, and shall enioy her Sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquitie: because, euen because they despised my Iudgements, and because their soule abhorred my Statutes
\v 44 And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, \x + \xo 26:44 \xt Deut. 4.31. rom. 11.26.\x*I will not cast them away, neither will I abhorre them, to destroy them vtterly, and to breake my couenant with them: for I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd* their God.
\v 45 But I wil for their sakes remember the couenant of their Ancestours, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt, in the sight of the Heathen, that I might be their God: I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 46 These \add are\add* the Statutes, and Iudgements, and Lawes which the \nd LORD\nd* made betweene him and the children of Israel, in mount Sinai, by the hand of Moses.
\c 27
\iex 1 He that maketh a singular vow must bee the \nd LORD\nd*s. 2 The estimation of the person. 9 Of a beast giuen by vow. 14 Of a house. 16 Of a field and the redemption thereof. 28 No deuoted thing may be redeemed. 32 The tithe may not be changed.
\v 1 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto Moses, saying,
\v 2 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them, When a man shal make a singular vow, the persons \add shall be\add* for the \nd LORD\nd*, by thy estimation.
\v 3 And thy estimation shall be: Of the male from twentie yeeres old, euen vnto sixtie yeeres old: euen thy estimation shall be fiftie shekels of siluer, after the shekel of the Sanctuary.
\v 4 And if it \add be\add* a female, then thy estimation shall be thirtie shekels.
\v 5 And if \add it be\add* from fiue yeeres olde, euen vnto twentie yeeres old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twentie shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
\v 6 And if \add it be\add* from a moneth old, euen vnto fiue yeeres old, then thy estimation \add shall be\add* of the male, fiue shekels of siluer, and for the female, thy estimation shall be three shekels of siluer.
\v 7 And if \add it be\add* from sixtie yeeres old, and aboue, if \add it be\add* a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteene shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
\v 8 But if he bee poorer then thy estimation, then he shall present himselfe before the Priest, and the Priest shall value him: according to his abilitie that vowed, shall the Priest value him.
\v 9 And if \add it be\add* a beast whereof men bring an offering vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, all that \add any man\add* giueth of such vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, shall be holy.
\v 10 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: And if hee shall at all change beast for beast, then it, and the exchange thereof shall be holy.
\v 11 And if \add it be\add* any vncleane beast, of which they doe not offer a sacrifice vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, then he shall present the beast before the Priest:
\v 12 And the Priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou \f + \fr 27:12 \ft Hebr. according to thy estimation, O Priest, &c.\f*valuest it \add who art\add* the Priest: so shall it be.
\v 13 But if hee will at all redeeme it, then he shall adde a fift \add part\add* thereof vnto thy estimation.
\v 14 ¶ And when a man shall sanctifie his house \add to be\add* holy vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, then the Priest shal estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the Priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.
\v 15 And if he that sanctified it, will redeeme his house, then he shall adde the fift \add part\add* of the money of thy estimation vnto it, and it shall be his.
\v 16 And if a man shall sanctifie vnto the \nd LORD\nd* \add some part\add* of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: \f + \fr 27:16 \ft Or, the land of an Homer, &c.\f*An Homer of barley seed \add shall be valued\add* at fiftie shekels of siluer.
\v 17 If hee sanctifie his field from the yeere of Iubile, according to thy estimation it shall stand.
\v 18 But if hee sanctifie his field after the Iubile, then the Priest shall reckon vnto him the money, according to the yeeres that remaine, euen vnto the yeere of the Iubile, and it shall be abated from thy estimation.
\v 19 And if he that sanctified the field, will in any wise redeeme it, then he shal adde the fift \add part\add* of the money of thy estimation vnto it, and it shall be assured to him.
\v 20 And if hee will not redeeme the field, or if he haue sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.
\v 21 But the field, when it goeth out in the Iubile, shall be holy vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, as a field deuoted: the possession thereof shalbe the Priests.
\v 22 And if \add a man\add* sanctifie vnto the \nd LORD\nd* a field which he hath bought, which \add is\add* not of the fieldes of his possession:
\v 23 Then the Priest shall reckon vnto him the worth of thy estimation, \add euen\add* vnto the yeere of the Iubile, and hee shall giue thine estimation in that day, \add as\add* a holy thing vnto the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 24 In the yeere of the Iubile, the field shall returne vnto him of whom it was bought, \add euen\add* to him to whom the possession of the land \add did belong\add*.
\v 25 And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the Sanctuarie: \x + \xo 27:25 \xt Exod. 30.13. num. 3.47. ezech. 45.12.\x*twentie Gerahs shall bee the shekel.
\v 26 ¶ Onely the firstling of the beasts which should be the \nd LORD\nd*s \f + \fr 27:26 \ft Hebr. first borne, &c.\f*firstling, no man shall sanctifie it, whether it bee oxe, or sheepe: It \add is\add* the \nd LORD\nd*s.
\v 27 And if \add it be\add* of an vncleane beast, then hee shall redeeme \add it\add* according to thine estimation, and shall adde a fifth \add part\add* of it thereto: Or if it be not redeemed, then it shalbe sold according to thy estimation.
\v 28 \x + \xo 27:28 \xt Iosh. 6.19.\x*Notwithstanding, no deuoted thing that a man shall deuote vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, of all that he hath, \add both\add* of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: euery deuoted thing \add is\add* most holy vnto the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 29 None deuoted, which shalbe deuoted of men, shall be redeemed: \add but\add* shall surely be put to death.
\v 30 And all the tithe of the land, \add whether\add* of the seed of the land, \add or\add* of the fruit of the tree, \add is\add* the \nd LORD\nd*s: \add it is\add* holy vnto the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 31 And if a man will at all redeeme \add ought\add* of his tithes, he shall adde thereto the fifth \add part\add* thereof.
\v 32 And concerning the tithe of the herde, or of the flocke, \add euen\add* of whatsoeuer passeth vnder the rod, the tenth shalbe holy vnto the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 33 He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it, and the change thereof, shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.
\v 34 These \add are\add* the Commandements which the \nd LORD\nd* commanded Moses, for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.
