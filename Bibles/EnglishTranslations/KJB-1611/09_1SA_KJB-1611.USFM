\iex 1 Elkanah a Leuite hauing two wiues, worshippeth yeerely at Shiloh. 4 Hee cherisheth Hannah, though barren, and prouoked by Peninnah. 9 Hannah in griefe, prayeth for a childe. 12 Eli first rebuking her, afterwards blesseth her. 19 Hannah hauing borne Samuel, stayeth at home till he be weaned. 24 She presenteth him, according to her vow, to the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 1 ¶ Now there was a certaine man of Ramathaim Zophim, of mount Ephraim, & his name \add was\add* Elkanah, the sonne of Ieroham, the sonne of Elihu, the sonne of Tohu, the sonne of Zuph, an Ephrathite;
\v 2 And he had two wiues, the name of the one \add was\add* Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
\v 3 And this man went vp out of his citie \x + \xo 1:3 \xt Deut. 16.16.\x*\f + \fr 1:3 \ft Hebr. from yeere to yeere.\f*yeerely, to worship and to sacrifice vnto the \nd LORD\nd* of hostes in Shiloh; and the two sonnes of Eli, Hophni, and Phinehas, the Priests of the \nd LORD\nd*, \add were\add* there.
\v 4 ¶ And when the time was, that Elkanah offered, he gaue to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sonnes, and her daughters, portions.
\v 5 But vnto Hannah he gaue \f + \fr 1:5 \ft Or, a double portion.\f*a worthy portion: (for he loued Hannah, but the \nd LORD\nd* had shut vp her wombe.
\v 6 And her aduersary also \f + \fr 1:6 \ft Hebr. angred her.\f*prouoked her sore, for to make her fret, because the \nd LORD\nd* had shut vp her wombe.)
\v 7 And \add as\add* he did so yeere by yeere, \f + \fr 1:7 \ft Or, from the time that she &c. Hebr. from her going vp.\f*when she went vp to the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, so she prouoked her; therefore she wept, and did not eat.
\v 8 Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieued? Am not I better to thee, then ten sonnes?
\v 9 ¶ So Hannah rose vp after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunke; (now Eli the Priest sate vpon a seat by a poste of the Temple of the \nd LORD\nd*.)
\v 10 And shee \add was\add* \f + \fr 1:10 \ft Hebr. bitter of soule.\f*in bitternesse of soule, and prayed vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, and wept sore.
\v 11 And she vowed a vow, and said, O \nd LORD\nd* of hostes, if thou wilt indeed looke on the affliction of thine handmayd, and remember me, and not forget thine handmayd, but wilt giue vnto thine handmayd \f + \fr 1:11 \ft Hebr. seed of men.\f*a man childe, then I will giue him vnto the \nd LORD\nd* all the dayes of his life, and \x + \xo 1:11 \xt Num. 6.5. iudg. 13.5.\x*there shall no rasor come vpon his head.
\v 12 And it came to passe as she \f + \fr 1:12 \ft Hebr. multiplied to pray.\f*continued praying before the \nd LORD\nd*, that Eli marked her mouth.
\v 13 Now Hannah, shee spake in her heart; onely her lippes mooued, but her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had beene drunken.
\v 14 And Eli said vnto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away thy wine from thee.
\v 15 And Hannah answered, and said, No, my lord, I \add am\add* a woman \f + \fr 1:15 \ft Hebr. hard of spirit.\f*of a sorrowfull spirit: I haue drunke neither wine nor strong drinke, but haue powred out my soule before the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 16 Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of the abundance of my \f + \fr 1:16 \ft Or, meditation.\f*complaint and griefe, haue I spoken hitherto.
\v 17 Then Eli answered, and said, Goe in peace: and the God of Israel grant \add thee\add* thy petition, that thou hast asked of him.
\v 18 And she said, Let thine handmaid finde grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and did eate, and her countenance was no more \add sad\add*.
\v 19 ¶ And they rose vp in the morning early, and worshipped before the \nd LORD\nd*, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah knewe Hannah his wife, and the \nd LORD\nd* remembred her.
\v 20 Wherefore it came to passe when the \f + \fr 1:20 \ft Hebr. reuelation of dayes.\f*time was come about, after Hannah had conceiued, that shee bare a sonne, and called his name \f + \fr 1:20 \ft That is, asked of God.\f*Samuel, \add saying\add*; Because I haue asked him of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 21 And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went vp to offer vnto the \nd LORD\nd* the yeerely sacrifice, and his vowe.
\v 22 But Hannah went not vp; for shee said vnto her husband, I will not goe vp vntill the childe be weaned, and \add then\add* I will bring him, that he may appeare before the \nd LORD\nd*, and there abide for euer.
\v 23 And Elkanah her husband said vnto her, Do what seemeth thee good, tary vntill thou haue weaned him, only the \nd LORD\nd* establish his word: so the woman abode, and gaue her sonne sucke vntill she weaned him.
\v 24 ¶ And when shee had weaned him, shee tooke him vp with her, with three bullocks, and one Ephah of floure, and a bottle of wine, and brought him vnto the house of the \nd LORD\nd* in Shiloh: and the childe \add was\add* young.
\v 25 And they slew a bullocke, and brought the childe to Eli.
\v 26 And she said, Oh my lord, \add as\add* thy soule liueth, my lord, I \add am\add* the woman, that stood by thee heere, praying vnto the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 27 For this childe I prayed, and the \nd LORD\nd* hath giuen me my petition, which I asked of him:
\v 28 Therefore also I haue \f + \fr 1:28 \ft Or, returned him, whom I have obtained by petition to the LORD.\f*lent him to the \nd LORD\nd* as long as hee liueth, \f + \fr 1:28 \ft Or, hee whom I haue obteined by petition, shalbe returned.\f*he shall be lent to the \nd LORD\nd*. And he worshipped the \nd LORD\nd* there.

\iex 1 Hannahs song in thankefulnesse. 12 The sinne of Elies sonnes. 18 Samuels ministerie. 20 By Elies blessing, Hannah is more fruitfull. 22 Eli reprooueth his sonnes. 28 A prophecie against Elies house.
\v 1 ¶ And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart reioyceth in the \nd LORD\nd*, mine horne is exalted in the \nd LORD\nd*: my mouth is inlarged ouer mine enemies: because I reioyce in thy saluation.
\v 2 \add There is\add* none holy as the \nd LORD\nd*: for \add there is\add* none beside thee: neither \add is there\add* any Rocke like our God.
\v 3 Talke no more so exceeding proudly, let \add not\add* \f + \fr 2:3 \ft Hebr. hard.\f*arrogancie come out of your mouth: for the \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.
\v 4 The vowes of the mightie men \add are\add* broken, and they that stumbled are girt with strength.
\v 5 \add They that were\add* full, haue hired out themselues for bread: and \add they that were\add* hungry, ceased: so that the barren hath borne seuen, and she that hath many children, is waxed feeble.
\v 6 \x + \xo 2:6 \xt Deut. 32.39. wisd. 16.13. tob. 13.2.\x*The \nd LORD\nd* killeth and maketh aliue, he bringeth downe to the graue, and bringeth vp.
\v 7 The \nd LORD\nd* maketh poore, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth vp.
\v 8 \x + \xo 2:8 \xt Psal. 113.7.\x*He raiseth vp the poore out of the dust, \add and\add* lifteth vp the begger from the dunghill, to set \add them\add* among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth \add are\add* the \nd LORD\nd*s, and hee hath set the world vpon them.
\v 9 He will keepe the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall bee silent in darkenesse; for by strength shall no man preuaile.
\v 10 The aduersaries of the \nd LORD\nd* shalbe broken to pieces: \x + \xo 2:10 \xt Chap.7.10.\x*out of heauen shal he thunder vpon them: the \nd LORD\nd* shall iudge the ends of the earth, and he shal giue strength vnto his king, and exalt the horne of his Anointed.
\v 11 And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house, and the child did minister vnto the \nd LORD\nd* before Eli the Priest.
\v 12 ¶ Now the sonnes of Eli \add were\add* sonnes of Belial, they knewe not the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 13 And the priests custome with the people \add was, that\add* when any man offred sacrifice, the priestes seruant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhooke of three teeth in his hand,
\v 14 And he strooke \add it\add* into the panne, or kettle, or caldron, or pot: all that the flesh-hooke brought vp, the priest tooke for himselfe: so they did in Shiloh vnto all the Israelites that came thither.
\v 15 Also before they burnt the fat, the priests seruant came, & said to the man that sacrificed, Giue flesh to roste for the priest, for he wil not haue sodden flesh of thee, but raw.
\v 16 And \add if\add* any man said vnto him, Let them not faile to burne the fat \f + \fr 2:16 \ft Hebr. as on the day.\f*presently, and \add then\add* take \add as much\add* as thy soule desireth: then hee would answere him, \add Nay\add*, but thou shalt giue \add it\add* mee now: and if not, I will take it by force.
\v 17 Wherefore the sinne of the yong men was very great before the \nd LORD\nd*: for men abhorred the offering of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 18 ¶ But Samuel ministred before the \nd LORD\nd*, \add being\add* a child, \x + \xo 2:18 \xt Exod. 28.4.\x*girded with a linnen Ephod.
\v 19 Moreouer, his mother made him a litle coate, and brought \add it\add* to him from yeere to yeere, when she came vp with her husband, to offer the yeerely sacrifice.
\v 20 ¶ And Eli blessed Elkanah, and his wife, and said, The \nd LORD\nd* giue thee seed of this woman, for the \f + \fr 2:20 \ft Or, petition which hee asked, &c.\f*loane which is lent to the \nd LORD\nd*. And they went vnto their owne home.
\v 21 And the \nd LORD\nd* visited Hannah, so that shee conceiued, and bare three sonnes, and two daughters: and the child Samuel grew before the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 22 ¶ Now Eli was very olde, and heard all that his sonnes did vnto all Israel, and how they lay with the women that \f + \fr 2:22 \ft Hebr. assembled by troupes.\f*assembled \add at\add* the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation
\v 23 And he said vnto them, Why doe ye such things? for \f + \fr 2:23 \ft Or, I hear euill words of you.\f*I heare of your euil dealings, by all this people.
\v 24 Nay my sonnes: for \add it is\add* no good report that I heare; yee make the \nd LORD\nd*s people to \f + \fr 2:24 \ft Or, to cry out.\f*transgresse.
\v 25 If one man sinne against another, the Iudge shall iudge him: but if a man sinne against the \nd LORD\nd*, who shall intreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not vnto the voice of their father, because the \nd LORD\nd* would slay them.
\v 26 (And the child Samuel grew on, and was in fauour, both with the \nd LORD\nd*, and also with men.)
\v 27 ¶ And there came a man of God vnto Eli, and saide vnto him, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Did I plainely appeare vnto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaohs house?
\v 28 And did I chuse him out of all the tribes of Israel, \add to be\add* my Priest, to offer vpon mine altar, to burne incense, to weare an Ephod before me? and \x + \xo 2:28 \xt Leuit. 10.14.\x*did I giue vnto the house of thy father, all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?
\v 29 Wherefore kicke ye at my sacrifice, and at mine offering, which I haue commaunded \add in my\add* habitation, and honourest thy sonnes aboue mee, to make your selues fat with the chiefest of all the offrings of Israel my people?
\v 30 Wherefore the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel saith, I sayd indeede \add that\add* thy house, & the house of thy father should walke before me for euer: but now the \nd LORD\nd* saith, Be it farre from mee; for them that honour me, I will honour, and they that despise me, shall be lightly esteemed.
\v 31 Behold, the dayes come, that I will cut off thine arme, and the arme of thy fathers house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.
\v 32 And thou shalt see \f + \fr 2:32 \ft Or, the affliction of the Tabernacle, for all the wealth which God would haue giuen Israel.\f*an enemie \add in my\add* habitation, in all \add the wealth\add* which \add God\add* shall giue Israel, and there shall not bee an olde man in thine house for euer.
\v 33 And the man of thine, \add whom\add* I shall not cut off from mine Altar, \add shall be\add* to consume thine eyes, and to grieue thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die \f + \fr 2:33 \ft Heb. men.\f*in the floure of their age.
\v 34 And this shall bee a signe vnto thee, that shall come vpon thy two sonnes, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die both of them.
\v 35 And I will raise me vp a faithfull Priest, \add that\add* shall doe according to \add that\add* which \add is\add* in my heart and in my mind, and I will build him a sure house, and hee shall walke before mine Anointed for euer.
\v 36 And it shall come to passe, \add that\add* euery one that is left in thine house, shal come \add and\add* crouch to him for a piece of siluer, and a morsel of bread, and shall say, \f + \fr 2:36 \ft Heb. ioyne.\f*Put me (I pray thee) into \f + \fr 2:36 \ft Or, Somewhat about the Priesthood.\f*one of the Priests offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.

\iex 1 How the word of the \nd LORD\nd* was first reuealed to Samuel. 11 God telleth Samuel the destruction of Elies house. 15 Samuel, though loth, telleth Eli the vision. 19 Samuel groweth in credit.
\v 1 ¶ And the child Samuel ministred vnto the \nd LORD\nd* before Eli: and the word of the \nd LORD\nd* was precious in those daies; \add there was\add* no open vision.
\v 2 And it came to passe at that time, when Eli \add was\add* layd downe in his place, and his eyes beganne to waxe dimme, \add that\add* he could not see;
\v 3 And yer the lampe of God went out in the Temple of the \nd LORD\nd*, where the Arke of God \add was\add*, and Samuel was layd downe to sleepe;
\v 4 That the \nd LORD\nd* called Samuel, and he answered, Here \add am\add* I.
\v 5 And he ranne vnto Eli, and sayd, Here \add am\add* I, for thou calledst me. And he said, I called not; lie downe againe. And he went and lay downe.
\v 6 And the \nd LORD\nd* called yet againe, Samuel. And Samuel arose, and went to Eli, and said, Here \add am\add* I, for thou diddest call me. And he answered, I called not, my sonne; lie downe againe.
\v 7 \f + \fr 3:7 \ft Or, thus did Samuel, before he knew the LORD; and before the word of the LORD was reuealed vnto him.\f*Now Samuel did not yet know the \nd LORD\nd*, neither was the word of the \nd LORD\nd* yet reuealed vnto him.
\v 8 And the \nd LORD\nd* called Samuel againe the third time. And hee arose, and went to Eli, and said, Here \add am\add* I, for thou diddest call me. And Eli perceiued that the \nd LORD\nd* had called the childe.
\v 9 Therefore Eli said vnto Samuel, Go, lie downe, & it shal be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speake \nd LORD\nd*, for thy seruant heareth. So Samuel went, and lay downe in his place.
\v 10 And the \nd LORD\nd* came, and stood and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speake, for thy seruant heareth.
\v 11 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* sayd to Samuel, Behold, I will doe a thing in Israel, at which, both the eares of \x + \xo 3:11 \xt 2.Kin. 21.12.\x*euery one that heareth it, shall tingle.
\v 12 In that day, I will performe against Eli, all \add things\add* which I haue spoken concerning his house: \f + \fr 3:12 \ft Hebr. beginning and ending.\f*when I begin, I will also make an end.
\v 13 \f + \fr 3:13 \ft Or, and I will tell him, &c.\f*\x + \xo 3:13 \xt Chap. 2.29,30,31, &c.\x*For I haue tolde him, that I will iudge his house for euer, for the iniquitie which hee knoweth: because his sonnes made themselues \f + \fr 3:13 \ft Or, accursed.\f*vile, and he \f + \fr 3:13 \ft Heb. frowned not vpon them.\f*restrained them not.
\v 14 And therefore I haue sworne vnto the house of Eli, that the iniquitie of Elies house shall not be purged with sacrifice, nor offering for euer.
\v 15 ¶ And Samuel lay vntill the morning, and opened the doores of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*: and Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.
\v 16 Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel my sonne. And he answered, Here \add am\add* I.
\v 17 And he said, What is the thing that the \nd LORD\nd* hath said vnto thee? I pray thee hide it not from mee: God doe so to thee, and \f + \fr 3:17 \ft Hebr. so adde.\f*more also, if thou hide any \f + \fr 3:17 \ft Or, word.\f*thing from me, of all the things that hee said vnto thee.
\v 18 And Samuel tolde him \f + \fr 3:18 \ft Heb all the things, or words.\f*euery whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It \add is\add* the \nd LORD\nd*: Let him doe what seemeth him good.
\v 19 ¶ And Samuel grew, and the \nd LORD\nd* was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.
\v 20 And all Israel from Dan euen to Beer-sheba, knew that Samuel was \f + \fr 3:20 \ft Or, faithfull.\f*established to bee a Prophet of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 21 And the \nd LORD\nd* appeared againe in Shiloh: for the \nd LORD\nd* reueiled himselfe to Samuel in Shiloh, by the word of the \nd LORD\nd*.

\iex 1 The Israelites are ouercome by the Philistines at Aben-Ezer. 3 They fetch the Arke, vnto the terrour of the Philistines. 10 They are smitten againe, the Arke taken, Hophni and Phinehas are slaine. 12 Eli at the newes, falling backward, breaketh his necke. 19 Phinehas wife, discouraged in her trauaile with Ichabod, dieth.
\v 1 ¶ And the word of Samuel \f + \fr 4:1 \ft Or, came to passe: Hebr. was.\f*came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battell, and pitched beside Eben-ezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.
\v 2 And the Philistines put themselues in aray against Israel: and when \f + \fr 4:2 \ft Hebr. the battell was spread.\f*they ioyned battell, Israel was smitten before the Philistines: and they slew of \f + \fr 4:2 \ft Hebr. the aray.\f*the armie in the field, about foure thousand men.
\v 3 ¶ And when the people were come into the campe, the Elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the \nd LORD\nd* smitten vs to day before the Philistines? Let vs \f + \fr 4:3 \ft Hebr. take vnto vs.\f*fetch the Arke of the Couenant of the \nd LORD\nd* out of Shiloh vnto vs, that when it commeth among vs, it may saue vs out of the hand of our enemies.
\v 4 So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from thence the Arke of the Couenant of the \nd LORD\nd* of hostes, which dwelleth betweene the Cherubims: and the two sonnes of Eli, Hophni, and Phinehas \add were\add* there, with the Arke of the Couenant of God.
\v 5 And when the Arke of the Couenant of the \nd LORD\nd* came into the campe, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang againe.
\v 6 And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What \add meaneth\add* the noise of this great shout in the campe of the Hebrewes? And they vnderstood, that the Arke of the \nd LORD\nd* was come into the campe.
\v 7 And the Philistines were afraid, for they saide, God is come into the campe. And they said, Woe vnto vs: for there hath not bene such a thing \f + \fr 4:7 \ft Hebr. yesterday, or the third day.\f*heretofore.
\v 8 Woe vnto vs: who shall deliuer vs out of the hand of these mightie Gods? these \add are\add* the Gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wildernesse.
\v 9 Bee strong, and quit your selues like men, O ye Philistines, that yee be not seruants vnto the Hebrewes, \x + \xo 4:9 \xt Iudg. 13.1.\x*as they haue bene to you: \f + \fr 4:9 \ft Hebr. Be men.\f*quit your selues like men, and fight.
\v 10 ¶ And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled euery man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter, for there fell of Israel thirtie thousand footmen.
\v 11 And the Arke of God was taken, and the two sonnes of Eli, Hophni, and Phinehas \f + \fr 4:11 \ft Hebr. died.\f*were slaine.
\v 12 ¶ And there ran a man of Beniamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth vpon his head.
\v 13 And when hee came, loe, Eli sate vpon a seat by the way side, watching: for his heart trembled for the Arke of God. And when the man came into the citie, and told \add it\add*, all the city cried out.
\v 14 And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, hee said; What \add meaneth\add* the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily, and told Eli.
\v 15 Now Eli was ninetie and eight yeeres old, and \x + \xo 4:15 \xt Chap. 3.2.\x*his eyes \f + \fr 4:15 \ft Hebr. stood.\f*were dimme, that he could not see.
\v 16 And the man said vnto Eli, I \add am\add* he, that came out of the army, and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What \f + \fr 4:16 \ft Hebr. is the thing.\f*is there done, my sonne?
\v 17 And the messenger answered, and said, Israel is fled before the Philistines, and there hath bene also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sonnes also, Hophni & Phinehas, are dead, and the Arke of God is taken.
\v 18 And it came to passe when hee made mention of the Arke of God, that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his necke brake, and hee died: for hee was an old man, and heauie, and hee had iudged Israel fortie yeeres.
\v 19 ¶ And his daughter in law Phinehas wife was with childe neere \f + \fr 4:19 \ft Or, to crie out.\f*to be deliuered: and when shee heard the tidings that the Arke of God was taken, and that her father in law, and her husband were dead, shee bowed her selfe and traueyled; for her paines \f + \fr 4:19 \ft Hebr. were turned.\f*came vpon her.
\v 20 And about the time of her death, the women that stood by her, said vnto her: Feare not, for thou hast borne a sonne. But she answered not, \f + \fr 4:20 \ft Heb. set not her heart\f*neither did she regard \add it\add*.
\v 21 And she named the childe \f + \fr 4:21 \ft That is, where is the glory?\f*Ichabod, saying, \f + \fr 4:21 \ft Or, there is no glory.\f*The glory is departed from Israel, (because the Arke of God was taken, and because of her father in law and her husband.)
\v 22 And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the Arke of God is taken.

\iex 1 The Philistines hauing brought the Arke into Ashdod, set it in the house of Dagon. 3 Dagon is smitten downe and cut in pieces, and they of Ashdod smitten with Emerods. 8 So God dealeth with them of Gath, when it was brought thither: 10 and so with them of Ekron when it was brought thither.
\v 1 ¶ And the Philistines tooke the Arke of God, and brought it from Ebenezer vnto Ashdod.
\v 2 When the Philistines tooke the Arke of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.
\v 3 ¶ And when they of Ashdod arose earely on the morrow, behold, Dagon \add was\add* fallen vpon his face to the earth, before the Arke of the \nd LORD\nd*: and they tooke Dagon, and set him in his place againe.
\v 4 And when they arose earely on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon \add was\add* fallen vpon his face to the ground, before the Arke of the \nd LORD\nd*: and the head of Dagon, and both the palmes of his hands \add were\add* cut off vpon the threshold, only \f + \fr 5:4 \ft Or, the filthy part.\f*the stumpe of Dagon was left to him.
\v 5 Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagons house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod vnto this day.
\v 6 But the hand of the \nd LORD\nd* was heauy vpon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with \x + \xo 5:6 \xt Psal. 78.66.\x*Emerods, \add euen\add* Ashdod, and the coastes thereof.
\v 7 And when the men of Ashdod saw that \add it was\add* so, they said, The Arke of the God of Israel shall not abide with vs: for his hand is sore vpon vs, and vpon Dagon our god.
\v 8 They sent therefore, and gathered all the lords of the Philistines vnto them, and said, What shall we doe with the Arke of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the Arke of the God of Israel bee caried about vnto Gath. And they caried the Arke of the God of Israel about \add thither\add*.
\v 9 And it was \add so\add*, that after they had caried it about, the hand of the \nd LORD\nd* was against the citie with a very great destruction: and hee smote the men of the citie both small and great, and they had Emerods in their secret parts.
\v 10 ¶ Therfore they sent the Arke of God to Ekron: and it came to passe as the Arke of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They haue brought about the Arke of the God of Israel to vs, to slay vs, and our people.
\v 11 So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, Send away the Arke of the God of Israel, and let it goe againe to his owne place, that it slay vs not, and our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the citie: The hand of God was very heauy there.
\v 12 And the men that died not, were smitten with the Emerods: and the cry of the citie went vp to heauen.
\c 6
\iex 1 After seuen moneths the Philistines take counsell, how to send backe the Arke. 10 They bring it on a new cart with an offering vnto Bethshemesh. 19 The people are smitten for looking into the Arke. 21 They send to them of Kiriath-iearim to fetch it.
\v 1 ¶ And the Arke of the \nd LORD\nd* was in the countrey of the Philistines seuen moneths.
\v 2 And the Philistines called for the priests and the diuiners, saying, What shall we doe to the Arke of the \nd LORD\nd*? Tell vs wherewith we shall send it to his place?
\v 3 And they said, If yee send away the Arke of the God of Israel, send it not empty: but in any wise returne him a trespasse offring: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be knowen to you, why his hand is not remooued from you.
\v 4 Then said they, What \add shall be\add* the trespasse offering, which wee shall returne to him? They answered, Fiue golden Emerods, and fiue golden mice, \add according to\add* the number of the lordes of the Philistines: for one plague \add was\add* on \f + \fr 6:4 \ft Heb. them.\f*you all, and on your lords.
\v 5 Wherefore ye shall make images of your Emerodes, and images of your Mice, that marre the land, and ye shall giue glory vnto the God of Israel: peraduenture hee will lighten his hand from off you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.
\v 6 Wherefore then doe yee harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought \f + \fr 6:6 \ft Or, reprochfully.\f*wonderfully among them, \x + \xo 6:6 \xt Exod. 12.31.\x*did they not let \f + \fr 6:6 \ft Heb. them.\f*the people goe, and they departed?
\v 7 Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch-kine, on which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart, and bring the calues home from them.
\v 8 And take the Arke of the \nd LORD\nd*, and lay it vpon the cart, and put the iewels of golde, which ye returne him \add for\add* a trespasse offering, in a coffer by the side thereof, and send it away, that it may goe.
\v 9 And see, if it goeth vp by the way of his owne coast to Bethshemesh, \add then\add* \f + \fr 6:9 \ft Or, it.\f*he hath done vs this great euill: but if not, then wee shall know that \add it is\add* not his hand \add that\add* smote vs; it \add was\add* a chance \add that\add* happened to vs.
\v 10 ¶ And the men did so: and tooke two milch-kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut vp their calues at home.
\v 11 And they layde the Arke of the \nd LORD\nd* vpon the cart, and the coffer, with the mice of golde, and the images of their Emerods.
\v 12 And the kine tooke the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh, \add and\add* went along the high way, lowing as they went, and turned not aside \add to\add* the right hand, or \add to\add* the left: and the lords of the Philistines went after them, vnto the border of Bethshemesh.
\v 13 And \add they of\add* Bethshemesh \add were\add* reaping their wheat haruest in the valley: and they lifted vp their eyes, and saw the Arke, and reioyced to see \add it\add*.
\v 14 And the cart came into the field of Ioshua a Bethshemite, & stood there, where \add there was\add* a great stone: and they claue the wood of the cart, and offered the kine, a burnt offering vnto the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 15 And the Leuites tooke downe the Arke of the \nd LORD\nd*, and the coffer that \add was\add* with it, wherein the iewels of golde \add were\add*, and put \add them\add* on the great stone: And the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offrings, and sacrificed sacrifices the same day vnto the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 16 And when the fiue lordes of the Philistines had seene \add it\add*, they returned to Ekron the same day.
\v 17 And these \add are\add* the golden Emerods which the Philistines returned \add for\add* a trespasse offering vnto the \nd LORD\nd*; for Ashdod one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one.
\v 18 And the golden Mice \add according to\add* the number of all the cities of the Philistines, \add belonging\add* to the fiue lordes, \add both\add* of fenced cities, and of countrey villages, euen vnto the \f + \fr 6:18 \ft Or, great stone.\f*great \add stone of\add* Abel, whereon they set downe the Arke of the \nd LORD\nd*; \add which stone remaineth\add* vnto this day, in the field of Ioshua the Bethshemite.
\v 19 ¶ And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked into the Arke of the \nd LORD\nd*, euen he smote of the people fiftie thousand, and threescore and tenne men: and the people lamented, because the \nd LORD\nd* had smitten \add many\add* of the people with a great slaughter.
\v 20 And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy \nd LORD\nd* God? and to whom shal he goe vp from vs?
\v 21 ¶ And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath-iearim, saying, The Philistines haue brought againe the Arke of the \nd LORD\nd*; come ye downe, \add and\add* fetch it vp to you.
\c 7
\iex 1 They of Kiriath-iearim bring the Arke into the house of Abinadab, and sanctifie Eleazar his sonne to keepe it. 2 After twentie yeeres 3 The Israelites, by Samuels meanes, solemnly repent at Mizpeh. 7 While Samuel prayeth and sacrificeth, the \nd LORD\nd* discomfiteth the Philistines by thunder, at Eben-ezer. 13 The Philistines are subdued. 15 Samuel peaceably and religiously iudgeth Israel.
\v 1 ¶ And the men of Kiriath-iearim came, and fetcht vp the Arke of the \nd LORD\nd*, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his sonne, to keepe the Arke of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 2 And it came to passe while the Arke abode in Kiriath-iearim, that the time was long: for it was twentie yeeres: and all the house of Israel lamented after the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 3 ¶ And Samuel spake vnto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye doe returne vnto the \nd LORD\nd* with all your hearts, \add then\add* \x + \xo 7:3 \xt Iosh. 14.15,23.\x*put away the strange gods, and \x + \xo 7:3 \xt Iudg. 2.13.\x*Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, and \x + \xo 7:3 \xt Deut. 6.4. matt. 4.10. luke 4.8.\x*serue him onely: & he will deliuer you out of the hand of the Philistines.
\v 4 Then the children of Israel did put away \x + \xo 7:4 \xt Iudg. 2.11.\x*Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and serued the \nd LORD\nd* onely.
\v 5 And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you vnto the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 6 And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and powred \add it\add* out before the \nd LORD\nd*, and fasted on that day, and said there, We haue sinned against the \nd LORD\nd*. And Samuel iudged the children of Israel in Mizpeh.
\v 7 And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went vp against Israel: and when the children of Israel heard \add it\add*, they were afraid of the Philistines.
\v 8 And the children of Israel said to Samuel, \f + \fr 7:8 \ft Heb. be not silent from vs from crying.\f*Cease not to crie vnto the \nd LORD\nd* our God for vs, that he will saue vs out of the hand of the Philistines.
\v 9 ¶ And Samuel tooke a sucking lambe, and offered \add it for\add* a burnt offering wholly vnto the \nd LORD\nd*; and Samuel cried vnto the \nd LORD\nd* for Israel, and the \nd LORD\nd* \f + \fr 7:9 \ft Or, answered.\f*heard him.
\v 10 And as Samuel was offering vp the burnt offering, the Philistines drewe neere to battell against Israel: but the \nd LORD\nd* thundred with a great thunder on that day vpon the Philistines, and discomfited them, and they were smitten before Israel.
\v 11 And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, vntill \add they came\add* vnder Bethcar.
\v 12 Then Samuel tooke a stone, and set \add it\add* betweene Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it \f + \fr 7:12 \ft That is, the stone of helpe.\f*Eben-Ezer, saying, Hitherto hath the \nd LORD\nd* helped vs.
\v 13 ¶ So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the coast of Israel: and the hand of the \nd LORD\nd* was against the Philistines, all the dayes of Samuel.
\v 14 And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel, were restored to Israel, from Ekron euen vnto Gath, and the coasts thereof did Israel deliuer out of the hands of the Philistines: and there was peace betweene Israel and the Amorites.
\v 15 And Samuel iudged Israel all the dayes of his life.
\v 16 And he went from yeere to yeere \f + \fr 7:16 \ft Heb. and he circuited.\f*in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and iudged Israel in all those places.
\v 17 And his returne \add was\add* to Ramah: for there \add was\add* his house: and there hee iudged Israel, and there hee built an altar vnto the \nd LORD\nd*.
\c 8
\iex 1 By occasion of the ill gouernment of Samuels sonnes, the Israelites aske a King. 6 Samuel praying in griefe is comforted by God. 10 Hee telleth the manner of a King. 19 God willeth Samuel to yeeld vnto the importunitie of the people.
\v 1 ¶ And it came to passe, when Samuel was old, that he made his sonnes Iudges ouer Israel.
\v 2 Now the name of his first borne was Ioel, and the name of his second, Abiah: \add they were\add* Iudges in Beer-sheba.
\v 3 And his sonnes walked not in his wayes, but turned aside after lucre, and \x + \xo 8:3 \xt Deut. 16.19.\x*tooke bribes, & peruerted iudgement.
\v 4 Then all the Elders of Israel gathered themselues together, and came to Samuel vnto Ramah,
\v 5 And said vnto him, Behold, thou art olde, and thy sonnes walke not in thy wayes: now \x + \xo 8:5 \xt Ose. 13.10. acts 13.21.\x*make vs a King to iudge vs, like all the nations.
\v 6 ¶ But the thing \f + \fr 8:6 \ft Heb. was euill in the eyes of Samuel.\f*displeased Samuel, when they said, Giue vs a King to iudge vs: and Samuel prayed vnto the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 7 And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Samuel, Hearken vnto the voyce of the people in all that they say vnto thee: for they haue not reiected thee, but they haue reiected mee, that I should not reigne ouer them.
\v 8 According to all the works which they haue done since the day that I brought them vp out of Egypt euen vnto this day, wherewith they haue forsaken me, and serued other gods: so doe they also vnto thee.
\v 9 Nowe therefore \f + \fr 8:9 \ft Or, obey.\f*hearken vnto their voyce: \f + \fr 8:9 \ft Or, notwithstanding, when thou hast solemnly protested against them, then thou shalt shew, &c.\f*howbeit, yet protest solemnly vnto them, and shew them the maner of the King that shall reigne ouer them.
\v 10 ¶ And Samuel told all the words of the \nd LORD\nd* vnto the people, that asked of him a King.
\v 11 And hee sayd, This will be the maner of the king that shall reigne ouer you: Hee will take your sonnes, and appoint \add them\add* for himselfe for his charets, and \add to bee\add* his horsemen, and \add some\add* shall runne before his charets.
\v 12 And hee will appoint him Captaines ouer thousands, and captaines ouer fifties, and \add will set them\add* to eare his ground, and to reape his haruest, and to make his instruments of warre, and instruments of his charets.
\v 13 And he will take your daughters \add to be\add* confectionaries, and \add to be\add* cookes, and \add to be\add* bakers.
\v 14 And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your oliue-yards, \add euen\add* the best \add of them\add*, and giue \add them\add* to his seruants.
\v 15 And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and giue to his \f + \fr 8:15 \ft Heb. Eunuches.\f*officers, and to his seruants.
\v 16 And hee will take your men seruants, and your mayd seruants, and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put \add them\add* to his worke.
\v 17 Hee will take the tenth of your sheepe, and ye shall be his seruants.
\v 18 And ye shall cry out in that day, because of your king which ye shall haue chosen you; and the \nd LORD\nd* will not heare you in that day.
\v 19 ¶ Neuerthelesse, the people refused to obey the voyce of Samuel; and they said, Nay, but we will haue a King ouer vs:
\v 20 That we also may be like all the nations, and that our King may iudge vs, and goe out before vs, and fight our battels.
\v 21 And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the eares of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 22 And the \nd LORD\nd* said to Samuel, Hearken vnto their voyce, and make them a King. And Samuel said vnto the men of Israel, Goe yee euery man vnto his citie.

\iex 1 Saul despairing to finde his fathers asses, 6 by the counsell of his seruaunt, 11 and direction of young maidens, 15 according to Gods reuelation, 18 commeth to Samuel. 19 Samuel entertaineth Saul at the feast. 25 Samuel after secret communication, bringeth Saul on his way.
\v 1 ¶ Now there was a man of Beniamin, whose name \add was\add* \x + \xo 9:1 \xt Chap. 14.51. 1.chro. 8.33.\x*Kish, the sonne of Abiel, the sonne of Zeror, the sonne of Bechorath, the sonne of Aphiah, a \f + \fr 9:1 \ft Or, the sonne of a man of Iemini.\f*Beniamite, a mighty man of \f + \fr 9:1 \ft Or, substance.\f*power.
\v 2 And he had a sonne, whose name \add was\add* Saul, a choice young man, and a goodly: and \add there was\add* not among the children of Israel a goodlier person then hee: from his shoulders and vpward, hee was higher then any of the people.
\v 3 And the asses of Kish, Sauls father, were lost; and Kish said to Saul his sonne, Take nowe one of the seruants with thee, and arise, goe seeke the asses.
\v 4 And he passed thorow mount Ephraim, and passed thorow the land of Shalisha, but they found \add them\add* not: then they passed thorow the land of Shalim, and \add there they were\add* not: and hee passed thorow the land of the Beniamites, but they found \add them\add* not.
\v 5 \add And\add* when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his seruant that \add was\add* with him, Come, and let vs returne, lest my father leaue \add caring\add* for the asses, and take thought for vs.
\v 6 And hee said vnto him, Behold now, \add there is\add* in this citie a man of God, and \add he is\add* an honourable man; all that he saith, commeth surely to passe: Now let vs goe thither; peraduenture he can shew vs our way that we should goe.
\v 7 Then said Saul to his seruaunt, But behold, \add if\add* we goe, what shall wee bring the man? for the bread is \f + \fr 9:7 \ft Hebr is gone out of &c.\f*spent in our vessels, and \add there is\add* not a present to bring to the man of God: What \f + \fr 9:7 \ft Hebr. is with vs?\f*haue wee?
\v 8 And the seruant answered Saul againe, and said, \f + \fr 9:8 \ft Hebr. there is found in my hand.\f*Behold, I haue here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of siluer; \add that\add* wil I giue to the man of God, to tell vs our way.
\v 9 (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake; Come, and let vs go to the Seer: for \add he that is\add* now \add called\add* a Prophet, was beforetime called a Seer.)
\v 10 Then said Saul to his seruant, \f + \fr 9:10 \ft Hebr. thy word is good.\f*Wel said, come, let vs go: so they went vnto the city where the man of God \add was\add*.
\v 11 ¶ \add And\add* as they went vp \f + \fr 9:11 \ft Hebr. in the ascent of the citie.\f*the hill to the city, they found yong maydens going out to draw water, and said vnto them, Is the Seer here?
\v 12 And they answered them, and said, He is: behold, \add he is\add* before you, make haste now: for he came to day to the citie; for \add there is\add* \f + \fr 9:12 \ft Or, feast.\f*a sacrifice of the people to day in the hie place.
\v 13 Assoone as ye be come into the citie, ye shall straightway finde him, before he goe vp to the high place to eate: for the people will not eate vntill hee come, because he doth blesse the sacrifice, \add and\add* afterwards they eat that be bidden: Now therefore get you vp, for \f + \fr 9:13 \ft Heb. to day.\f*about this time ye shall finde him.
\v 14 And they went vp into the citie: \add and\add* when they were come into the citie, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to goe vp to the hie place.
\v 15 ¶ \x + \xo 9:15 \xt Chap. 15.1. acts. 13.21.\x*Now the \nd LORD\nd* had \f + \fr 9:15 \ft Heb. reveiled the eare of Samuel.\f*told Samuel in his eare a day before Saul came, saying,
\v 16 To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Beniamin, and thou shalt anoynt him \add to be\add* Captaine ouer my people Israel, that he may saue my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I haue looked vpon my people, because their cry is come vnto me.
\v 17 And when Samuel saw Saul, the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of: this same shall \f + \fr 9:17 \ft Hebr. restraine in.\f*reigne ouer my people.
\v 18 Then Saul drew neere to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the Seers house \add is\add*.
\v 19 And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I \add am\add* the Seer: Goe vp before me vnto the high place, for ye shall eate with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee goe, and will tell thee all that \add is\add* in thine heart.
\v 20 And as for thine asses that were lost \f + \fr 9:20 \ft Hebr. to day three dayes.\f*three dayes agoe, set not thy minde on them, for they are found: And on whom is all the desire of Israel? is it not on thee, & on all thy fathers house?
\v 21 And Saul answered, and said, \add Am\add* not I a Beniamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of Beniamin? Wherefore then speakest thou \f + \fr 9:21 \ft Hebr. according to this word?\f*so to me?
\v 22 And Samuel tooke Saul, and his seruant, and brought them into the parlour, & made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which \add were\add* about thirtie persons.
\v 23 And Samuel said vnto the cooke, Bring the portion which I gaue thee, of which I said vnto thee, Set it by thee.
\v 24 And the cooke took vp the shoulder, and \add that\add* which \add was\add* vpon \add it\add*, and set it before Saul, and \add Samuel\add* said, Behold, that which is \f + \fr 9:24 \ft Or, reserued.\f*left, set \add it\add* before thee, \add and\add* eate: for vnto this time hath it bene kept for thee, since I said I haue inuited the people: So Saul did eat with Samuel that day.
\v 25 ¶ And when they were come downe from the high place into the citie, \add Samuel\add* communed with Saul vpon the top of the house.
\v 26 And they arose early: and it came to passe about the spring of the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away: And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, hee and Samuel, abroad.
\v 27 \add And\add* as they were going downe to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the seruant passe on before vs, (and he passed on) but stand thou still \f + \fr 9:27 \ft Hebr. to day.\f*a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.
\c 10
\iex 1 Samuel anoynteth Saul. 2 Hee confirmeth him by prediction of three signes. 9 Sauls heart is changed, and he prophecieth. 14 He concealeth the matter of the kingdome from his vncle. 17 Saul is chosen at Mizpeh by lot. 26 The different affections of his subiects.
\v 1 ¶ Then Samuel tooke a viall of oile, and powred \add it\add* vpon his head, & kissed him, and said, \add Is it\add* not because the \nd LORD\nd* hath anoynted thee \add to be\add* captain ouer his inheritance?
\v 2 When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find two men by \x + \xo 10:2 \xt Gen. 35.20.\x*Rachels sepulchre in the border of Beniamin, at Zelzah: and they will say vnto thee, The asses which thou wentest to seeke, are found: and loe, thy father hath left \f + \fr 10:2 \ft Heb. the businesse.\f*the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I doe for my sonne?
\v 3 Then shalt thou goe on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plaine of Tabor, and there shall meete thee three men, going vp to God to Bethel, one carying three kids, and another carying three loaues of bread, and another carying a bottle of wine.
\v 4 And they will \f + \fr 10:4 \ft Heb. aske thee of peace\f*salute thee, and giue thee two \add loaues\add* of bread, which thou shalt receiue of their hands.
\v 5 After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where \add is\add* the garison of the Philistines: and it shall come to passe when thou art come thither to the citie, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets comming downe from the high place, with a psalterie, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harpe before them, and they shall prophecie.
\v 6 And the Spirit of the \nd LORD\nd* will come vpon thee, and thou shalt prophecie with them, and shalt be turned into another man.
\v 7 And \f + \fr 10:7 \ft Heb. and it shall come to passe that when these signes &c.\f*let it be when these signes are come vnto thee, \f + \fr 10:7 \ft Heb. do for thee as thine hand shall finde.\f*\add that\add* thou doe as occasion serue thee, for God \add is\add* with thee.
\v 8 And thou shalt goe downe before me to Gilgal, and behold, I will come downe vnto thee, to offer burnt offerings, \add and\add* to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: \x + \xo 10:8 \xt Chap. 13.8.\x*seuen dayes shalt thou tarie, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt doe.
\v 9 ¶ And it was \add so\add* that when he had turned his \f + \fr 10:9 \ft Heb. shoulder.\f*backe to go from Samuel, God \f + \fr 10:9 \ft Heb. turned.\f*gaue him another heart: and all those signes came to passe that day.
\v 10 And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of the prophets met him, and the spirit of God came vpon him, and hee prophesied among them.
\v 11 And it came to passe when all that knew him beforetime, saw, that behold, hee prophesied among the prophets, then the people said \f + \fr 10:11 \ft Heb. A man to his neighbour.\f*one to another, What is this that is come vnto the sonne of Kish? \x + \xo 10:11 \xt Chap. 19.24.\x*Is Saul also among the prophets?
\v 12 And one \f + \fr 10:12 \ft Heb. from thence.\f*of the same place answered, and sayd, But who \add is\add* their father? Therefore it became a prouerbe, \add Is\add* Saul also among the Prophets?
\v 13 And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.
\v 14 ¶ And Sauls vncle saide vnto him, and to his seruant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seeke the asses: and when we saw that \add they were\add* no where, we came to Samuel.
\v 15 And Sauls vncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said vnto you.
\v 16 And Saul sayd vnto his vncle; He told vs plainely that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdome, whereof Samuel spake, he told him not.
\v 17 ¶ And Samuel called the people together vnto the \nd LORD\nd* to Mizpeh;
\v 18 And said vnto the children of Israel, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, I brought vp Israel out of Egypt, and deliuered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdomes, \add and\add* of them that oppressed you.
\v 19 And ye haue this day reiected your God, who himselfe saued you out of all your aduersities & your tribulations: and ye haue said vnto him, \add Nay\add*, but set a king ouer vs. Now therefore present your selues before the \nd LORD\nd* by your tribes, and by your thousands.
\v 20 And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come neere, the tribe of Beniamin was taken.
\v 21 When he had caused the tribe of Beniamin to come neere by their families, the familie of Matri was taken, and Saul the sonne of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.
\v 22 Therefore they enquired of the \nd LORD\nd* further, if the man should yet come thither: and the \nd LORD\nd* answered, Behold, hee hath hid himselfe among the stuffe.
\v 23 And they ranne, and fetched him thence, and when he stood among the people, he was higher then any of the people, from the shoulders & vpward.
\v 24 And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whome the \nd LORD\nd* hath chosen, that \add there is\add* none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and saide, \f + \fr 10:24 \ft Heb. let the king liue\f*God saue the King.
\v 25 Then Samuel tolde the people the maner of the kingdome, and wrote \add it\add* in a booke, and layd \add it\add* vp before the \nd LORD\nd*, and Samuel sent all the people away, euery man to his house.
\v 26 ¶ And Saul also went home to Gibeah, and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.
\v 27 But the children of Belial sayd, Howe shall this man saue vs? and they despised him, and brought him no presents: but \f + \fr 10:27 \ft Or, he was, as though he had beene deafe.\f*he held his peace.

\iex 1 Nahash offereth them of Iabesh Gilead a reprochfull condition. 4 They send messengers and are deliuered by Saul. 12 Saul thereby is confirmed, and his kingdome renewed.
\v 1 ¶ Then Nahash the Ammonite came vp, and encamped against Iabesh Gilead: and all the men of Iabesh sayde vnto Nahash, Make a couenant with vs, and we will serue thee.
\v 2 And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this \add condition\add* will I make \add a couenant\add* with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes, and lay it \add for\add* a reproch vpon all Israel.
\v 3 And the Elders of Iabesh sayd vnto him, \f + \fr 11:3 \ft Hebr. forbeare vs.\f*Giue vs seuen daies respite, that we may send messengers vnto all the coasts of Israel: and then, if \add there be\add* no man to saue vs, we will come out to thee.
\v 4 ¶ Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the tidings in the eares of the people: and all the people lift vp their voyces, and wept.
\v 5 And behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field, and Saul sayd, What \add aileth\add* the people that they weep? and they told him the tidings of the men of Iabesh.
\v 6 And the Spirit of God came vpon Saul, when he heard those tydings, and his anger was kindled greatly.
\v 7 And he tooke a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent \add them\add* throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whosoeuer commeth not foorth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it bee done vnto his oxen: and the feare of the \nd LORD\nd* fell on the people, and they came out \f + \fr 11:7 \ft Heb. as one man.\f*with one consent.
\v 8 And when he numbred them in Bezek, the children of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Iudah thirty thousand.
\v 9 And they said vnto the messengers that came, Thus shall yee say vnto the men of Iabesh Gilead, To morrow by \add that time\add* the sunne be hote, ye shal haue \f + \fr 11:9 \ft Or, deliuerance.\f*helpe. And the messengers came, and shewed \add it\add* to the men of Iabesh, and they were glad.
\v 10 Therfore the men of Iabesh said, To morrow wee will come out vnto you, and ye shall doe with vs all that seemeth good vnto you.
\v 11 And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three cōpanies, and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch, and slewe the Ammonites, vntill the heat of the day: and it came to passe, that they which remained were scattered, so that two of them were not left together.
\v 12 ¶ And the people said vnto Samuel, Who \add is\add* he that said, Shall Saul reigne ouer vs? bring the men, that we may put them to death.
\v 13 And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day: for to day the \nd LORD\nd* hath wrought saluation in Israel.
\v 14 Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let vs goe to Gilgal, and renew the kingdome there.
\v 15 And all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul King before the \nd LORD\nd* in Gilgal: and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the \nd LORD\nd*: and there Saul and all the men of Israel reioyced greatly.

\iex 1 Samuel testifieth his integritie. 6 Hee reprooueth the people of ingratitude. 16 He terrifieth them with thunder in haruest time. 20 He comforteth them in Gods mercy.
\v 1 ¶ And Samuel saide vnto all Israel, Beholde, I haue hearkned vnto your voice in all that ye said vnto mee, and haue made a King ouer you.
\v 2 And now behold, the King walketh before you: and I am olde, and gray headed, and behold, my sonnes \add are\add* with you: and I haue walked before you from my childhood vnto this day.
\v 3 Behold, \x + \xo 12:3 \xt Ecclus. 46.10.\x*here I \add am\add*, witnesse against me before the \nd LORD\nd*, and before his Anoynted: Whose oxe haue I taken? or whose asse haue I taken? or whom haue I defrauded? whom haue I oppressed? or of whose hand haue I receiued \add any\add* \f + \fr 12:3 \ft Hebr. ransome.\f*bribe \f + \fr 12:3 \ft Or, that I should hide mine eyes at at him.\f*to blinde mine eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.
\v 4 And they said, Thou hast not defrauded vs, nor oppressed vs, neither hast thou taken ought of any mans hand.
\v 5 And hee said vnto them, The \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* witnesse against you, and his Anointed \add is\add* witnesse this day, that ye haue not found ought in my hand: And they answered, \add He is\add* witnesse.
\v 6 ¶ And Samuel said vnto the people, \add It is\add* the \nd LORD\nd* that \f + \fr 12:6 \ft Or, made.\f*aduanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers vp out of the land of Egypt.
\v 7 Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the \nd LORD\nd*, of all the \f + \fr 12:7 \ft Hebr. righteousnesses, Or, benefits.\f*righteous acts of the \nd LORD\nd*, which he did \f + \fr 12:7 \ft Heb. with.\f*to you and your fathers.
\v 8 \x + \xo 12:8 \xt Gen. 46.5,6.\x*When Iacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, then the \nd LORD\nd* \x + \xo 12:8 \xt Exod. 4.16.\x*sent Moses and Aaron, which brought foorth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.
\v 9 And when they forgat the \nd LORD\nd* their God, \x + \xo 12:9 \xt Iudg. 4.2.\x*he sold them into the hand of Sisera captaine of the hoste of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.
\v 10 And they cried vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, and said, Wee haue sinned, because we haue forsaken the \nd LORD\nd*, and haue serued Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliuer vs out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serue thee.
\v 11 And the \nd LORD\nd* sent Ierubbaal, and Bedan, and \x + \xo 12:11 \xt Iudg. 11.1.\x*Iephthah, and Samuel, and deliuered you out of the hand of your enemies on euery side, and yee dwelled safe.
\v 12 And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, ye said vnto me, Nay, but a King shall reigne ouer vs, when the \nd LORD\nd* your God \add was\add* your King.
\v 13 Now therefore, behold the King whom yee haue chosen, \add and\add* whom yee haue desired: and behold, the \nd LORD\nd* hath set a King ouer you.
\v 14 If ye will feare the \nd LORD\nd*, and serue him, and obey his voice, and not rebell against the \f + \fr 12:14 \ft Hebr. mouth.\f*Commandement of the \nd LORD\nd*, then shall both ye and also the King that reigneth ouer you, \f + \fr 12:14 \ft Hebr. be after.\f*continue following the \nd LORD\nd* your God.
\v 15 But if ye wil not obey the voice of the \nd LORD\nd*, but rebel against the Commandement of the \nd LORD\nd*, then shall the hand of the \nd LORD\nd* be against you, as \add it was\add* against your fathers.
\v 16 ¶ Now therefore stand and see this great thing which the \nd LORD\nd* will doe before your eyes.
\v 17 \add Is it\add* not wheat haruest to day? I will call vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, and hee shall send thunder and raine, that ye may perceiue and see that your wickednesse \add is\add* great, which ye haue done in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, in asking you a King.
\v 18 So Samuel called vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, and the \nd LORD\nd* sent thunder and raine that day: and all the people greatly feared the \nd LORD\nd* and Samuel.
\v 19 And all the people said vnto Samuel, Pray for thy seruants vnto the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, that we die not: for we haue added vnto all our sinnes, \add this\add* euil, to aske vs a King.
\v 20 ¶ And Samuel saide vnto the people, Feare not: (ye haue done al this wickednesse, yet turne not aside from following the \nd LORD\nd*, but serue the \nd LORD\nd* with all your heart:
\v 21 And turne ye not aside, for then should ye goe after vaine \add things\add*, which cannot profit, nor deliuer, for they \add are\add* vaine.)
\v 22 For the \nd LORD\nd* wil not forsake his people, for his great Names sake: because it hath pleased the \nd LORD\nd* to make you his people.
\v 23 Moreouer, as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the \nd LORD\nd*, \f + \fr 12:23 \ft Hebr. from ceasing.\f*in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way.
\v 24 Onely feare the \nd LORD\nd*, and serue him in trueth with all your heart: for consider \f + \fr 12:24 \ft Or, what a great thing &c.\f*how great \add things\add* he hath done for you.
\v 25 But if yee shall still doe wickedly, yee shall be consumed, both yee and your King.

\iex 1 Sauls selected band. 3 Hee calleth the Hebrewes to Gilgal against the Philistines, whose garrison Ionathan had smitten. 5 The Philistines great hoste. 6 The distresse of the Israelites. 8 Saul weary of staying for Samuel, sacrificeth. 11 Samuel reproueth him. 17 The three spoiling bands of the Philistines. 19 The policie of the Philistines, to suffer no Smith in Israel.
\v 1 ¶ Saul \f + \fr 13:1 \ft Hebr. the sonne of one yeere in his reigning.\f*reigned one yeere, and when he had reigned two yeeres ouer Israel,
\v 2 Saul chose him three thousand \add men\add* of Israel: \add whereof\add* two thousand were with Saul in Michmash, and in mount Bethel, and a thousand were with Ionathan in Gibeah of Beniamin: and the rest of the people he sent euery man to his tent.
\v 3 And Ionathan smote the garison of the Philistines that \add was\add* in \f + \fr 13:3 \ft Or, the hill.\f*Geba, and the Philistines heard \add of it\add*: and Saul blew the trumpet thorowout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrewes heare.
\v 4 And all Israel heard say, \add that\add* Saul had smitten a garison of the Philistines, and \add that\add* Israel also \f + \fr 13:4 \ft Hebr. did stinke.\f*was had in abomination with the Philistines: and the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.
\v 5 ¶ And the Philistines gathered themselues together, to fight with Israel, thirtie thousand charets, and sixe thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which \add is\add* on the sea shore in multitude, and they came vp, and pitched in Michmash, Eastward from Bethauen.
\v 6 When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait: (for the people were distressed:) then the people did hide themselues in caues, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in high places, and in pits.
\v 7And \add some of\add* the Hebrewes went ouer Iordane, to the land of Gad and Gilead; as for Saul, he \add was\add* yet in Gilgal, and all the people  \f + \fr 13:7 \ft Hebr. trembled after him.\f*followed him trembling.
\v 8 ¶ \x + \xo 13:8 \xt Chap. 10.8.\x*And he taried seuen dayes, according to the set time that Samuel \add had appointed\add*: but Samuel came not to Gilgal, and the people were scattered from him.
\v 9 And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offring to me, and peace offrings. And he offered the burnt offering.
\v 10 And it came to passe that assoone as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came, and Saul went out to meete him, that he might \f + \fr 13:10 \ft Heb. blesse him.\f*salute him.
\v 11 ¶ And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I sawe that the people were scattered from me, and \add that\add* thou camest not within the dayes appointed, and \add that\add* the Philistines gathered themselues together to Michmash:
\v 12 Therfore said I, The Philistines will come downe now vpon me to Gilgal, and I haue not \f + \fr 13:12 \ft Hebr. intreated the face.\f*made supplication vnto the \nd LORD\nd*: I forced my selfe therefore, and offered a burnt offering.
\v 13 And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast not kept the commandement of the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, which hee commanded thee: for now would the \nd LORD\nd* haue established thy kingdome vpon Israel for euer.
\v 14 But now thy kingdome shall not continue: the \nd LORD\nd* hath sought him a man after his owne heart, and the \nd LORD\nd* hath commanded him \add to bee\add* captaine ouer his people, because thou hast not kept \add that\add* which the \nd LORD\nd* commanded thee.
\v 15 And Samuel arose, and gate him vp from Gilgal, vnto Gibeah of Beniamin, and Saul numbred the people \add that were\add* \f + \fr 13:15 \ft Heb. found\f*present with him, about sixe hundred men.
\v 16 And Saul and Ionathan his sonne, and the people \add that were\add* present with them, abode in Gibeah of Beniamin: but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
\v 17 ¶ And the spoilers came out of the campe of the Philistines, in three companies: one company turned vnto the way \add that leadeth to\add* Ophrah, vnto the land of Shual.
\v 18 And another company turned the way \add to\add* Bethoron: and another companie turned \add to\add* the way of the border, that looketh to the valley of Zeboim toward the wildernesse.
\v 19 ¶ Now there was no smith found thorowout all the land of Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrewes make \add them\add* swords or speares.
\v 20 But all the Israelites went downe to the Philistines, to sharpen euery man his share and his coulter, and his axe, and his mattocke.
\v 21 Yet they had a \f + \fr 13:21 \ft Hebr. a file with mouthes.\f*file for the mattocks, and for the coulters, and for the forkes, and for the axes, and \f + \fr 13:21 \ft Heb. to set.\f*to sharpen the goads.
\v 22 So it came to passe in the day of battell, that there was neither sword nor speare found in the hand of any of the people that \add were\add* with Saul and Ionathan: but with Saul & with Ionathan his sonne was there found.
\v 23 And the \f + \fr 13:23 \ft Or, standing campe.\f*garison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.

\iex 1 Ionathan, vnwitting to his father, the Priest, or the people, goeth and miraculously smiteth the Philistines garrison. 15 A diuine terrour maketh them beate themselues. 17 Saul not staying the Priests answere, setteth on them. 21 The captiuated Hebrewes, and the hidden Israelites, ioyne against them. 24 Sauls vnaduised adiuration, hindreth the victory. 32 Hee restraineth the people from eating blood. 35 He buildeth an Altar. 36 Ionathan taken by lot, is saued by the people. 47 Sauls strength and family.
\v 1 ¶ Now \f + \fr 14:1 \ft Or, there was a day.\f*it came to passe vpon a day, that Ionathan the sonne of Saul said vnto the yong man that bare his armour, Come, and let vs goe ouer to the Philistines garison, that \add is\add* on the other side: but hee told not his father.
\v 2 And Saul taried in the vttermost part of Gibeah, vnder a Pomegranate tree, which \add is\add* in Migron: and the people that \add were\add* with him, \add were\add* about sixe hundred men:
\v 3 And Ahiah the sonne of Ahitub, \x + \xo 14:3 \xt Chap. 4.21.\x*Ichabods brother, the sonne of Phinehas, the sonne of Eli, the \nd LORD\nd*s Priest in Shiloh, wearing an Ephod: and the people knew not that Ionathan was gone.
\v 4 ¶ And betweene the passages, by which Ionathan sought to go ouer vnto the Philistines garison, \add there was\add* a sharpe rocke on the one side, and a sharp rocke on the other side: and the name of the one \add was\add* Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.
\v 5 The \f + \fr 14:5 \ft Heb. tooth.\f*forefront of the one \add was\add* situate Northward ouer against Michmash, and the other Southward ouer against Gibeah.
\v 6 And Ionathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let vs goe ouer vnto the garison of these vncircumcised; it may be that the \nd LORD\nd* will worke for vs: for \add there is\add* no restraint to the \nd LORD\nd*, \x + \xo 14:6 \xt 2.Chron. 14.11.\x*to saue by many, or by few.
\v 7 And his armour bearer sayd vnto him, Doe all that \add is\add* in thine heart: turne thee, behold, I \add am\add* with thee, according to thy heart.
\v 8 Then said Ionathan, Behold, we will passe ouer vnto \add these\add* men, and we will discouer our selues vnto them.
\v 9 If they say thus vnto vs, \f + \fr 14:9 \ft Heb. be still.\f*Tary vntill we come to you: then wee will stand still in our place, and will not goe vp vnto them.
\v 10 But if they say thus, Come vp vnto vs: then we will goe vp; for \x + \xo 14:10 \xt 1.Macc. 4.30.\x*the \nd LORD\nd* hath deliuered them into our hand: and this \add shall be\add* a signe vnto vs.
\v 11 And both of them discouered themselues vnto the garison of the Philistines: and the Philistines sayd, Behold, the Hebrewes come foorth out of the holes, where they had hid themselues.
\v 12 And the men of the garison answered Ionathan and his armour bearer, and said, Come vp to vs, and wee will shew you a thing. And Ionathan said vnto his armour bearer, Come vp after me; for the \nd LORD\nd* hath deliuered them into the hand of Israel.
\v 13 And Ionathan climed vp vpon his hands, and vpon his feete, and his armour bearer after him: and they fell before Ionathan; and his armour bearer slew after him.
\v 14 And that first slaughter which Ionathan and his armour-bearer made, was about twentie men, within as it were \f + \fr 14:14 \ft Or, halfe a furrow of an acre of land.\f*an halfe acre of land, \add which\add* a yoke \add of oxen might plow\add*.
\v 15 And there was trembling in the hoste, in the field, and among all the people: the garison and the spoilers, they also trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was \f + \fr 14:15 \ft Hebr. a trembling of God.\f*a very great trembling.
\v 16 And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Beniamin looked: and behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating downe \add one another\add*.
\v 17 Then said Saul vnto the people that \add were\add* with him, Number now, and see who is gone from vs. And when they had numbred, behold, Ionathan and his armour bearer \add were\add* not \add there\add*.
\v 18 And Saul said vnto Ahiah, Bring hither the Arke of God: (for the Arke of God was at that time with the children of Israel.)
\v 19 ¶ And it came to passe while Saul talked vnto the Priest, that the \f + \fr 14:19 \ft Or, tumult.\f*noise that \add was\add* in the hoste of the Philistines went on, and increased: And Saul said vnto the Priest, Withdraw thine hand.
\v 20 And Saul and all the people that \add were\add* with him \f + \fr 14:20 \ft Heb. were cryed together.\f*assembled themselues, and they came to the battel, and behold, \x + \xo 14:20 \xt Iudg. 7.22. 2.chro. 20.23.\x*euery mans sword was against his fellow, \add and there was\add* a very great discomfiture.
\v 21 Moreouer, the Hebrewes \add that\add* were with the Philistines before that time, which went vp with them into the campe from the countrey round about; euen they also \add turned\add* to be with the Israelites, that \add were\add* with Saul and Ionathan.
\v 22 Likewise all the men of Israel, which had hid themselues in mount Ephraim, \add when\add* they heard that the Philistines fled, euen they also followed hard after them in the battell.
\v 23 So the \nd LORD\nd* saued Israel that day: and the battell passed ouer vnto Beth-auen.
\v 24 ¶ And the men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul had adiured the people, saying, Cursed bee the man that eateth any foode vntill euening, that I may \add be\add* auenged on mine enemies: so none of the people tasted \add any\add* food.
\v 25 And all \add they of\add* the land came to a wood, and there was honie vpon the ground.
\v 26 And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honie dropped, but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.
\v 27 But Ionathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath; wherefore he put foorth the ende of the rodde that \add was\add* in his hand, and dipt it in an hony combe, and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes were enlightened.
\v 28 Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed \add be\add* the man that eateth \add any\add* food this day. And the people were \f + \fr 14:28 \ft Or, wearie.\f*faint.
\v 29 Then said Ionathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I pray you, how mine eyes haue beene enlightened, because I tasted a little of this honie:
\v 30 How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoile of their enemies which they found? for had there not beene now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?
\v 31 And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aiialon: and the people were very faint.
\v 32 And the people flewe vpon the spoile, and tooke sheepe, and oxen, and calues, and slew \add them\add* on the ground, and the people did eate \add them\add* \x + \xo 14:32 \xt Leuit. 7.26. and 19.26. deut. 12.16.\x*with the blood.
\v 33 ¶ Then they tolde Saul, saying, Behold, the people sinne against the \nd LORD\nd*, in that they eate with the blood. And he said, Yee haue \f + \fr 14:33 \ft Or, dealt treacherously.\f*transgressed: roule a great stone vnto mee this day.
\v 34 And Saul said, Disperse your selues among the people, and say vnto them, Bring me hither euery man his oxe, and euery man his sheepe, and slay \add them\add* here, and eat, and sinne not against the \nd LORD\nd* in eating with the blood. And all the people brought euery man his oxe \f + \fr 14:34 \ft Heb. in his hand.\f*with him that night, and slew \add them\add* there.
\v 35 And Saul built an altar vnto the \nd LORD\nd*: \f + \fr 14:35 \ft Hebr. that Altar he beganne to build vnto the LORD.\f*the same was the first altar that he built vnto the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 36 ¶ And Saul saide, Let vs goe downe after the Philistines by night, and spoile them vntil the morning light, and let vs not leaue a man of them. And they said, Do whatsoeuer seemeth good vnto thee. Then said the priest, Let vs draw neere hither vnto God.
\v 37 And Saul asked counsell of God, Shall I goe downe after the Philistines? Wilt thou deliuer them into the hand of Israel? But he answered him not that day.
\v 38 And Saul said, Draw yee neere hither \x + \xo 14:38 \xt Iudg. 20.2.\x*all the \f + \fr 14:38 \ft Heb. corners.\f*chiefe of the people: and know and see, wherein this sinne hath beene this day.
\v 39 For \add as\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liueth, which saueth Israel, though it bee in Ionathan my sonne, he shall surely die: But \add there was\add* not a man among all the people \add that\add* answered him.
\v 40 Then said he vnto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I, and Ionathan my sonne will be on the other side. And the people said vnto Saul, Doe what seemeth good vnto thee.
\v 41 Therefore Saul saide vnto the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, \f + \fr 14:41 \ft Or, shew the innocent\f*Giue a perfect \add lot\add*. And Saul and Ionathan were taken: but the people \f + \fr 14:41 \ft Heb. went forth.\f*escaped.
\v 42 And Saul said, Cast \add lots\add* betweene me and Ionathan my sonne. And Ionathan was taken.
\v 43 Then Saul said to Ionathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Ionathan tolde him, and said, I did but taste a litle hony with the end of the rodde that \add was\add* in mine hand, \add and\add* loe, I must die.
\v 44 And Saul answered, God do so, and more also: for thou shalt surely die, Ionathan.
\v 45 And the people said vnto Saul, Shall Ionathan die, who hath wrought this great saluation in Israel? God forbid: \add as\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liueth, there shal not one haire of his head fall to the ground: for hee hath wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Ionathan, that hee died not.
\v 46 Then Saul went vp from following the Philistines: and the Philistines went to their owne place.
\v 47 ¶ So Saul tooke the kingdom ouer Israel, and fought against all his enemies on euery side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoeuer hee turned himselfe, he vexed \add them\add*.
\v 48 And he \f + \fr 14:48 \ft Or, wroght mightily.\f*gathered an hoste, and smote the Amalekites, and deliuered Israel out of the handes of them that spoiled them.
\v 49 Now the sonnes of Saul, were Ionathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters \add were these\add*: the name of the first borne Merab, and the name of the yonger Michal:
\v 50 And the name of Sauls wife \add was\add* Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz, and the name of the captaine of his host \add was\add* Abner, the sonne of Ner, Sauls vncle.
\v 51 And Kish \add was\add* the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner \add was\add* the sonne of Abiel.
\v 52 And there was sore warre against the Philistines, all the dayes of Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he tooke him vnto him.

\iex 1 Samuel sendeth Saul to destroy Amalek. 6 Saul fauoureth the Kenites. 8 Hee spareth Agag and the best of the spoile. 10 Samuel denounceth vnto Saul commending and excusing himselfe, Gods reiection of him for his disobedience. 24 Sauls humiliation. 32 Samuel killeth Agag. 34 Samuel and Saul part.
\v 1 ¶ Samuel also saide vnto Saul, \x + \xo 15:1 \xt Chap. 9.16.\x*The \nd LORD\nd* sent me to annoint thee \add to bee\add* king ouer his people, ouer Israel: nowe therefore hearken thou vnto the voyce of the words of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 2 Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, I remember \add that\add* which Amalek did to Israel, \x + \xo 15:2 \xt Exod. 17.8. num. 24.20.\x*how he laid \add wait\add* for him in the way when he came vp from Egypt.
\v 3 Now goe, and smite Amalek, and vtterly destroy all that they haue, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, oxe and sheepe, camell and asse.
\v 4 And Saul gathered the people together, and numbred them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Iudah.
\v 5 And Saul came to a citie of Amalek, and \f + \fr 15:5 \ft Or, fought.\f*laid waite in the valley.
\v 6 ¶ And Saul saide vnto the Kenites, Goe, depart, get you downe from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for yee shewed kindnesse to all the children of Israel when they came vp out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.
\v 7 And Saul smote the Amalekites from Hauilah, vntill thou commest to Shur, that \add is\add* ouer against Egypt.
\v 8 And hee tooke Agag the king of the Amalekites aliue, and vtterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
\v 9 But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheepe, and of the oxen, and of the \f + \fr 15:9 \ft Or, of the second sort.\f*fatlings, and the lambes, and all \add that was\add* good, and would not vtterly destroy them: but euery thing \add that was\add* vile, and refuse, that they destroyed vtterly.
\v 10 ¶ Then came the word of the \nd LORD\nd* vnto Samuel, saying;
\v 11 It repenteth me that I haue set vp Saul \add to be\add* king: for hee is turned backe from following me, and hath not performed my commandements. And it grieued Samuel; and he cried vnto the \nd LORD\nd* all night.
\v 12 And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was tolde Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set him vp a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone downe to Gilgal.
\v 13 And Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said vnto him, Blessed \add be\add* thou of the \nd LORD\nd*: I haue performed the commandement of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 14 And Samuel said, What \add meaneth\add* then this bleating of the sheepe in mine eares, and the lowing of the oxen which I heare?
\v 15 And Saul sayde, They haue brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheepe, and of the oxen, to sacrifice vnto the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, and the rest we haue vtterly destroyed.
\v 16 Then Samuel sayd vnto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the \nd LORD\nd* hath said to mee this night. And he said vnto him, Say on.
\v 17 And Samuel said, When thou \add wast\add* litle in thine owne sight, \add wast\add* thou not \add made\add* the Head of the tribes of Israel, and the \nd LORD\nd* anointed thee King ouer Israel?
\v 18 And the \nd LORD\nd* sent thee on a iourney, and said, Goe, and vtterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them, vntill \f + \fr 15:18 \ft Heb. they consume them.\f*they be consumed.
\v 19 Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the \nd LORD\nd*, but didst flie vpon the spoile, and didst euill in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*?
\v 20 And Saul said vnto Samuel; Yea, I haue obeyed the voice of the \nd LORD\nd*, and haue gone the way which the \nd LORD\nd* sent me, and haue brought Agag the king of Amalek, and haue vtterly destroyed the Amalekites.
\v 21 But the people tooke of the spoile, sheepe and oxen, the chiefe of the things which should haue bene vtterly destroyed, to sacrifice vnto the \nd LORD\nd* thy God in Gilgal.
\v 22 And Samuel saide, Hath the \nd LORD\nd* \add as great\add* delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the \nd LORD\nd*? Behold, \x + \xo 15:22 \xt Eccles. 4.17. ose.6.7. matt.9.13. and 12.7.\x*to obey, \add is\add* better then sacrifice: \add and\add* to hearken, then the fat of rammes.
\v 23 For rebellion \add is as\add* the sin of \f + \fr 15:23 \ft Heb. diuination.\f*witchcraft, and stubburnnesse \add is as\add* iniquitie and idolatrie: because thou hast reiected the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, he hath also reiected thee from \add being\add* king.
\v 24 ¶ And Saul said vnto Samuel, I haue sinned: for I haue transgressed the Commandement of the \nd LORD\nd*, and thy wordes; because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.
\v 25 Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sinne, and turne againe with me, that I may worship the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 26 And Samuel said vnto Saul, I will not returne with thee: for thou hast reiected the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, and the \nd LORD\nd* hath reiected thee from being king ouer Israel.
\v 27 And as Samuel turned about to goe away, he laid hold vpon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.
\v 28 And Samuel said vnto him, The \nd LORD\nd* hath rent the kingdome of Israel from thee this day, and hath giuen it to a neighbour of thine, \add that is\add* better then thou.
\v 29 And also the \f + \fr 15:29 \ft Or, eternitie: or, victory.\f*strength of Israel will not lie, nor repent: for he \add is\add* not a man that he should repent.
\v 30 Then he said, I haue sinned; \add yet\add* honour me now, I pray thee, before the Elders of my people, and before Israel, and turne againe with me, that I may worship the \nd LORD\nd* thy God.
\v 31 So Samuel turned againe after Saul, and Saul worshipped the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 32 ¶ Then said Samuel, Bring you hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites: and Agag came vnto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitternesse of death is past.
\v 33 And Samuel said, \x + \xo 15:33 \xt Exod. 17.11. num. 14.45.\x*As thy sword hath made women childlesse, so shall thy mother bee childlesse among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the \nd LORD\nd* in Gilgal.
\v 34 ¶ Then Samuel went to Ramah, and Saul went vp to his house to Gibeah of Saul.
\v 35 And Samuel came no more to see Saul vntill the day of his death: neuerthelesse, Samuel mourned for Saul: and the \nd LORD\nd* repented that he had made Saul king ouer Israel.
\c 16
\iex 1 Samuel sent by God, vnder pretence of a sacrifice, commeth to Bethlehem. 6 His humane iudgement is reprooued. 11 He anointeth Dauid. 15 Saul sendeth for Dauid to quiet his euill spirit.
\v 1 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourne for Saul, seeing I haue reiected him from reigning ouer Israel? Fill thine horne with oile, and goe, I will send thee to Iesse the Bethlehemite: for I haue prouided mee a King among his sonnes.
\v 2 And Samuel said, How can I goe? if Saul heare \add it\add*, he will kill mee. And the \nd LORD\nd* said, Take an heifer \f + \fr 16:2 \ft Hebr. in thine hand.\f*with thee, and say, I am come to sacrifice to the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 3 And call Iesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what thou shalt doe: and thou shalt anoynt vnto mee \add him\add* whom I name vnto thee.
\v 4 And Samuel did that which the \nd LORD\nd* spake, and came to Bethlehem: and the elders of the towne trembled at his \f + \fr 16:4 \ft Hebr. meeting.\f*comming, and said, Commest thou peaceably?
\v 5 And hee said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice vnto the \nd LORD\nd*: sanctifie your selues, and come with me to the sacrifice: and he sanctified Iesse, and his sonnes, and called them to the sacrifice.
\v 6 ¶ And it came to passe when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the \nd LORD\nd*s anointed \add is\add* before him.
\v 7 But the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Samuel, Looke not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature, because I haue refused him: for the \nd LORD\nd* seeth not, as man seeth; For man looketh on the \f + \fr 16:7 \ft Hebr. eyes.\f*outward appearance, but the \nd LORD\nd* looketh on the \x + \xo 16:7 \xt 1.Chron. 28.9. psal. 7.9. ierem. 11.20. and 17.10. and 20.12.\x*heart.
\v 8 Then Iesse called Abinadab, and made him passe before Samuel: and he said, Neither hath the \nd LORD\nd* chosen this.
\v 9 Then Iesse made Shammah to passe by: and he said, Neither hath the \nd LORD\nd* chosen this.
\v 10 Againe Iesse made seuen of his sonnes to passe before Samuel; and Samuel said vnto Iesse, The \nd LORD\nd* hath not chosen these.
\v 11 And Samuel saide vnto Iesse, Are here all \add thy\add* children? And he said, There remaineth yet the yongest, and behold, he keepeth the sheepe. And Samuel said vnto Iesse, \x + \xo 16:11 \xt 2.Sam. 7.8. psal. 78.71.\x*Send, and fetch him: for we will not sit \f + \fr 16:11 \ft Heb. round.\f*downe, till hee come hither.
\v 12 And he sent, and brought him in: now he \add was\add* ruddy, \add and\add* withal \f + \fr 16:12 \ft Hebr. faire of eyes.\f*of a beautifull countenance, and goodly to looke to: And the \nd LORD\nd* said, Arise, anoint him: for this \add is\add* he.
\v 13 Then Samuel tooke the horne of oile, and annointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the \nd LORD\nd* came vpon Dauid, from that day forward: So Samuel rose vp and went to Ramah.
\v 14 ¶ But the spirit of the \nd LORD\nd* departed from Saul, and an euil spirit from the \nd LORD\nd* \f + \fr 16:14 \ft Or, terrified.\f*troubled him.
\v 15 And Sauls seruants said vnto him, Behold now, an euill spirit from God troubleth thee.
\v 16 Let our lord now command thy seruants \add which are\add* before thee, to seeke out a man, \add who is\add* a cunning player on an harpe: and it shall come to passe when the euill spirit from God is vpon thee, that hee shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.
\v 17 And Saul said vnto his seruants, Prouide mee now a man, that can play well, and bring \add him\add* to me.
\v 18 Then answered one of the seruants, and said, Behold, I haue seene a sonne of Iesse the Bethlehemite, \add that is\add* cunning in playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of warre, and prudent in \f + \fr 16:18 \ft Or, speech.\f*matters, and a comely person, and the \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* with him.
\v 19 ¶ Wherefore Saul sent messengers vnto Iesse, and said, Send me Dauid thy sonne, which \add is\add* with the sheepe.
\v 20 And Iesse tooke an asse \add laden\add* with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent \add them\add* by Dauid his sonne vnto Saul.
\v 21 And Dauid came to Saul, and stood before him: and hee loued him greatly, and hee became his armour bearer.
\v 22 And Saul sent to Iesse, saying, Let Dauid, I pray thee, stand before me: for hee hath found fauour in my sight.
\v 23 And it came to passe, when the euill spirit from God was vpon Saul, that Dauid tooke an harpe, and played with his hand: So Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the euill spirit departed from him.
\c 17
\iex 1 The armies of the Israelites, and Philistines beeing readie to battell, 4 Goliath commeth proudly forth, to chalenge a combate. 12 Dauid sent by his father to visit his brethren, taketh the chalenge. 28 Eliab chideth him. 30 He is brought to Saul. 32 He sheweth the reason of his confidence. 38 Without armour, armed by faith, he slayeth the Giant. 55 Saul taketh notice of Dauid.
\v 1 ¶ Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battell, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which \add belongeth\add* to Iudah, and pitched betweene Shochoh and Azekah, in \f + \fr 17:1 \ft Or, the coast of Dammim.\f*Ephes-Dammim.
\v 2 And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and \f + \fr 17:2 \ft Heb. ranged the battell.\f*set the battell in aray against the Philistines.
\v 3 And the Philistines stood on a mountaine on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountaine on the other side: and \add there was\add* a valley betweene them.
\v 4 ¶ And there went out a champion out of the campe of the Philistines, named Goliath of Gath: whose height \add was\add* sixe cubites and a span.
\v 5 And \add he had\add* an helmet of brasse vpon his head, and he \add was\add* \f + \fr 17:5 \ft Heb. cloathed.\f*armed with a coate of male: and the weight of the coat \add was\add* fiue thousand shekels of brasse.
\v 6 And \add he had\add* greaues of brasse vpon his legs, and a \f + \fr 17:6 \ft Or, gorget.\f*target of brasse betweene his shoulders.
\v 7 And the staffe of his speare \add was\add* like a weauers beame, and his speares head \add weighed\add* sixe hundred shekels of yron: and one bearing a shield, went before him.
\v 8 And hee stood and cried vnto the armies of Israel, and said vnto them, Why are yee come out to set your battell in aray? am not I a Philistine, and you seruants to Saul? chuse you a man for you, and let him come downe to me.
\v 9 If he be able to fight with mee, and to kill me, then will we be your seruants: but if I preuaile against him, and kill him, then shall yee be our seruants, and serue vs.
\v 10 And the Philistine said, I defie the armies of Israel this day; giue me a man, that we may fight together.
\v 11 When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.
\v 12 ¶ Now Dauid \add was\add* \x + \xo 17:12 \xt Chap. 16.1.\x*the sonne of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Iudah, whose name \add was\add* Iesse, and hee had eight sonnes: and the man went among men \add for\add* an old man in the dayes of Saul.
\v 13 And the three eldest sonnes of Iesse went, \add and\add* followed Saul to the battell: and the names of his three sonnes that went to the battell, \add were\add*, Eliab the first borne, and next vnto him, Abinadab, and the third, Shammah.
\v 14 And Dauid \add was\add* the yongest: and the three eldest followed Saul.
\v 15 But Dauid went, and returned from Saul, to feed his fathers sheepe at Bethlehem.
\v 16 And the Philistine drewe neere, morning and euening, and presented himselfe forty dayes.
\v 17 And Iesse said vnto Dauid his sonne, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corne, and these ten loaues, and run to the campe to thy brethren.
\v 18 And carie these ten \f + \fr 17:18 \ft Heb. cheeses of milke.\f*cheeses vnto the \f + \fr 17:18 \ft Heb. captaine of a thousand.\f*Captaine of \add their\add* thousand, and looke how thy brethren fare, and take their pledge.
\v 19 Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel \add were\add* in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.
\v 20 ¶ And Dauid rose vp earely in the morning, and left the sheepe with a keeper, and tooke, and went, as Iesse had commanded him; and he came to the \f + \fr 17:20 \ft Or, place of the cariage.\f*trench, as the host was going forth to \f + \fr 17:20 \ft Or, battell ray, or place of fight.\f*the fight, and shouted for the battell.
\v 21 For Israel and the Philistines had put the battel in aray, army against armie.
\v 22 And Dauid left \f + \fr 17:22 \ft Hebr. the vessels from vpon him.\f*his cariage in the hand of the keeper of the cariage, and ranne into the armie, and came and \f + \fr 17:22 \ft Heb. asked his brethren of peace.\f*saluted his brethren.
\v 23 And as he talked with them, behold, there came vp the champion (the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name) out of the armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same words: and Dauid heard \add them\add*.
\v 24 And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled \f + \fr 17:24 \ft Heb. from his face.\f*from him, and were sore afraid.
\v 25 And the men of Israel said, Haue yee seene this man that is come vp? Surely to defie Israel is he come vp: and it shall be \add that\add* the man who killeth him, the king wil enrich him with great riches, and \x + \xo 17:25 \xt Iosh. 15.16.\x*will giue him his daughter, and make his fathers house free in Israel.
\v 26 And Dauid spake to the men that stood by him, saying; What shall bee done to the man that killeth this Philistine; and taketh away the reproch from Israel? for who is this vncircumcised Philistine, that he should defie the armies of the liuing God?
\v 27 And the people answered him after this maner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that killeth him.
\v 28 ¶ And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake vnto the men, and Eliabs anger was kindled against Dauid, and he said, Why camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those few sheepe in the wildernesse? I know thy pride, and the naughtinesse of thine heart; for thou art come downe, that thou mightest see the battell.
\v 29 And Dauid saide, What haue I now done? \add Is there\add* not a cause?
\v 30 ¶ And hee turned from him towards another, and spake after the same \f + \fr 17:30 \ft Hebr. word.\f*maner: and the people answered him againe after the former maner.
\v 31 And when the words were heard which Dauid spake, they rehearsed \add them\add* before Saul: and he \f + \fr 17:31 \ft Heb. tooke him.\f*sent for him.
\v 32 ¶ And Dauid said to Saul, Let no mans heart faile, because of him: thy seruant will goe and fight with this Philistine.
\v 33 And Saul said to Dauid, Thou art not able to goe against this Philistine, to fight with him: for thou \add art but\add* a youth, and he a man of warre from his youth.
\v 34 And Dauid said vnto Saul, Thy seruant kept his fathers sheepe, and there came a Lyon, and a Beare, and tooke a \f + \fr 17:34 \ft Or, kid.\f*lambe out of the flocke:
\v 35 And I went out after him, and smote him, and deliuered \add it\add* out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught \add him\add* by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.
\v 36 Thy seruant slew both the Lyon and the Beare: and this vncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he hath defied the armies of the liuing God.
\v 37 Dauid saide moreouer, The \nd LORD\nd* that deliuered me out of the paw of the Lyon, and out of the pawe of the Beare, he will deliuer me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said vnto Dauid, Goe, and the \nd LORD\nd* be with thee.
\v 38 ¶ And Saul \f + \fr 17:38 \ft Heb. cloathed, &c. with his cloathes.\f*armed Dauid with his armour, and hee put an helmet of brasse vpon his head, also he armed him with a coat of male.
\v 39 And Dauid girded his sword vpon his armour, and he assayed to goe, for he had not proued \add it\add*: and Dauid said vnto Saul, I cannot goe with these: for I haue not proued \add them\add*. And Dauid put them off him.
\v 40 And hee tooke his staffe in his hand, and chose him fiue smoothe stones out of the \f + \fr 17:40 \ft Or, valley.\f*brooke, and put them in a shepheards \f + \fr 17:40 \ft Heb. vessell.\f*bag which he had, euen in a scrip, and his sling \add was\add* in his hande, and he drew neere to the Philistine.
\v 41 And the Philistine came on and drew neere vnto Dauid, and the man that bare the shield, \add went\add* before him.
\v 42 And when the Philistine looked about, and saw Dauid, hee disdained him: for he was \add but\add* a youth, and ruddy, and of a faire countenance.
\v 43 And the Philistine said vnto Dauid, Am I a dog, that thou commest to me with staues? and the Philistine cursed Dauid by his gods.
\v 44 And the Philistine said to Dauid, Come to me, and I will giue thy flesh vnto the foules of the aire, and to the beasts of the field.
\v 45 Then said Dauid to the Philistine, Thou commest to mee with a sword, and with a speare, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the Name of the \nd LORD\nd* of hostes, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.
\v 46 This day wil the \nd LORD\nd* \f + \fr 17:46 \ft Hebr. sent thee vp.\f*deliuer thee into mine hand, and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee, and I wil giue the carkeises of the host of the Philistines this day vnto the foules of the aire, and to the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.
\v 47 And all this assembly shal know that the \nd LORD\nd* saueth not with sword & speare (for the battell \add is\add* the \nd LORD\nd*s) and he will giue you into our hands.
\v 48 And it came to passe when the Philistine arose, and came, and drewe nigh to meet Dauid, that Dauid hasted, and ran toward the armie to meete the Philistine.
\v 49 And Dauid put his hande in his bag, and tooke thence a stone, and slang \add it\add*, & smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunke into his forehead, and he fell vpon his face to the earth.
\v 50 So \x + \xo 17:50 \xt Ecclus. 47.4. 1.Macc. 4.30.\x*Dauid preuailed ouer the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him, but \add there was\add* no sword in the hande of Dauid.
\v 51 Therefore Dauid ran and stood vpon the Philistine, and tooke his sword, and drewe it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines sawe their champion was dead, they fled.
\v 52 And the men of Israel, and of Iudah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, vntill thou come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron: and the wounded of the Philistines fell downe by the way to Shaaraim, euen vnto Gath, and vnto Ekron.
\v 53 And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.
\v 54 And Dauid tooke the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Ierusalem, but he put his armour in his tent.
\v 55 ¶ And when Saul sawe Dauid goe forth against the Philistine, he sayd vnto Abner the captaine of the hoste, Abner, whose sonne \add is\add* this youth? And Abner said, \add As\add* thy soule liueth, O king, I cannot tell.
\v 56 And the king said, Enquire thou whose sonne the stripling \add is\add*.
\v 57 And as Dauid returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner tooke him, & brought him before Saul, with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
\v 58 And Saul saide to him, Whose sonne \add art\add* \add thou\add*, thou yong man? And Dauid answered, I \add am\add* the sonne of thy seruant Iesse, the Bethlehemite.
\c 18
\iex 1 Ionathan loueth Dauid. 5 Saul enuieth his praise, 10 Seeketh to kill him in his furie, 12 Feareth him for his good successe, 17 Offereth him his daughters for a snare. 22 Dauid perswaded to be the Kings sonne in law, giueth two hundred foreskinnes of the Philistines for Michals dowrie. 28 Sauls hatred, and Dauids glory increaseth.
\v 1 ¶ And it came to passe when hee made an ende of speaking vnto Saul, that the soule of Ionathan was knit with the soule of Dauid, and Ionathan loued him as his owne soule.
\v 2 And Saul tooke him that day, and would let him go no more home to his fathers house.
\v 3 Then Ionathan and Dauid made a couenant, because he loued him as his owne soule.
\v 4 And Ionathan stript himselfe of the robe that \add was\add* vpon him, and gaue it to Dauid, and his garments, euen to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.
\v 5 ¶ And Dauid went out, whither soeuer Saul sent him, \add and\add* \f + \fr 18:5 \ft Or, prospered.\f*behaued himselfe wisely: and Saul set him ouer the men of warre, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Sauls seruants.
\v 6 And it came to passe as they came when Dauid was returned from the slaughter of the \f + \fr 18:6 \ft Or, Philistines.\f*Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meete king Saul, with tabrets, with ioy, and with \f + \fr 18:6 \ft Heb. three stringed instruments.\f*instruments of musicke.
\v 7 And the women answered \add one another\add* as they played, and said, \x + \xo 18:7 \xt Chap. 21.11. and 29.5. ecclus. 47.6.\x*Saul hath slaine his thousands, and Dauid his ten thousands.
\v 8 And Saul was very wroth, and the saying \f + \fr 18:8 \ft Hebr. was euill in his eyes.\f*displeased him, and he sayd, They haue ascribed vnto Dauid tenne thousands, and to me they haue ascribed \add but\add* thousands: and \add what\add* can he haue more, but the kingdome?
\v 9 And Saul eyed Dauid from that day, and forward.
\v 10 ¶ And it came to passe on the morrow, that the euill spirit from God came vpon Saul, and he prophecied in the midst of the house: and Dauid played with his hand, as at other times: and \add there was\add* a iauelin in Sauls hand.
\v 11 And Saul cast the iauelin; for hee said, I will smite Dauid euen to the wall \add with it\add*: and Dauid auoided out of his presence twice.
\v 12 ¶ And Saul was afraid of Dauid, because the \nd LORD\nd* was with him, and was departed from Saul.
\v 13 Therefore Saul remooued him from him, and made him his captaine ouer a thousand, and hee went out and came in before the people.
\v 14 And Dauid \f + \fr 18:14 \ft Or, prospered.\f*behaued himselfe wisely in all his wayes; & the \nd LORD\nd* \add was\add* with him.
\v 15 Wherefore when Saul saw that hee behaued himselfe very wisely, hee was afraid of him.
\v 16 But all Israel and Iudah loued Dauid, because hee went out and came in before them.
\v 17 ¶ And Saul said to Dauid, Behold, my elder daughter Merab, her will I giue thee to wife: onely be thou \f + \fr 18:17 \ft Hebr. a sonne of valour.\f*valiant for me, and fight the \nd LORD\nd*s battels: for Saul said, Let not mine hand be vpon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be vpon him.
\v 18 And Dauid said vnto Saul, Who \add am\add* I? and what \add is\add* my life, \add or\add* my fathers family in Israel, that I should be sonne in law to the king?
\v 19 But it came to passe at the time when Merab Sauls daughter should haue beene giuen to Dauid, that shee was giuen vnto Adriel the Meholathite to wife.
\v 20 And Michal Sauls daughter loued Dauid: and they tolde Saul, and the thing \f + \fr 18:20 \ft Hebr. was right in his eyes.\f*pleased him.
\v 21 And Saul said, I will giue him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Wherefore Saul said to Dauid, Thou shalt this day be my sonne in law, in \add the one of\add* the twaine.
\v 22 ¶ And Saul commanded his seruants, \add saying\add*, Commune with Dauid secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and all his seruants loue thee: now therefore be the kings sonne in law.
\v 23 And Sauls seruants spake those wordes in the eares of Dauid: And Dauid said, Seemeth it to you \add a\add* light \add thing\add* to be a kings sonne in law, seeing that I \add am\add* a poore man, and lightly esteemed?
\v 24 And the seruants of Saul tolde him, saying; \f + \fr 18:24 \ft Hebr. according to these words.\f*On this manner spake Dauid.
\v 25 And Saul said, Thus shall yee say to Dauid, The King desireth not any dowrie, but an hundred foreskinnes of the Philistines, to be auenged of the kings enemies. But Saul thought to make Dauid fal by the hand of the Philistines.
\v 26 And when his seruants told Dauid these wordes, it pleased Dauid well to be the kings sonne in lawe: and the dayes were not \f + \fr 18:26 \ft Hebr. fulfilled.\f*expired.
\v 27 Wherefore Dauid arose, hee and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men, and Dauid brought their foreskinnes, and they gaue them in full tale to the king, that hee might be the kings sonne in law: and Saul gaue him Michal his daughter to wife.
\v 28 ¶ And Saul saw and knew that the \nd LORD\nd* \add was\add* with Dauid, and \add that\add* Michal Sauls daughter loued him.
\v 29 And Saul was yet the more afraid of Dauid; and Saul became Dauids enemie continually.
\v 30 Then the Princes of the Philistines went foorth: and it came to passe after they went foorth, \add that\add* Dauid behaued himselfe more wisely then all the seruants of Saul, so that his name was \f + \fr 18:30 \ft Hebr. precious.\f*much set by.
\c 19
\iex 1 Ionathan discloseth his fathers purpose to kill Dauid. 4 Hee perswadeth his father to reconciliation. 8 By reason of Dauids good successe in a new warre, Sauls malicious rage breaketh out against him. 12 Michal deceiueth her father with an image in Dauids bed. 18 Dauid commeth to Samuel in Naioth. 20 Sauls messengers sent to take Dauid, 22 and Saul himselfe, prophesie.
\v 1 ¶ And Saul spake to Ionathan his sonne, and to all his seruants, that they should kill Dauid.
\v 2 But Ionathan Sauls sonne delighted much in Dauid, and Ionathan told Dauid, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: Now therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thy selfe vntill the morning, and abide in a secret \add place\add*, and hide thy selfe:
\v 3 And I will goe out and stand beside my father in the field where thou \add art\add*, and I will commune with my father of thee, and what I see, that I will tell thee.
\v 4 ¶ And Ionathan spake good of Dauid vnto Saul his father, and said vnto him, Let not the King sinne against his seruant, against Dauid: because hee hath not sinned against thee, and because his workes haue bene to thee ward very good.
\v 5 For he did put his \x + \xo 19:5 \xt Iudg. 9.17. and 12.3. chap. 28.21. psalm. 119.109.\x*life in his hand, and slew the Philistine, & the \nd LORD\nd* wrought a great saluation for all Israel: thou sawest \add it\add*, and didst reioyce: Wherefore then wilt thou sinne against innocent blood, to slay Dauid without a cause?
\v 6 And Saul hearkened vnto the voyce of Ionathan; and Saul sware, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liueth, he shall not be slaine.
\v 7 And Ionathan called Dauid, and Ionathan shewed him all those things: and Ionathan brought Dauid to Saul, and he was in his presence, as \f + \fr 19:7 \ft Hebr. yesterday, third day.\f*in times past.
\v 8 ¶ And there was warre againe, and Dauid went out, and fought with the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter, & they fled from \f + \fr 19:8 \ft Heb. his face.\f*him.
\v 9 And the euill spirit from the \nd LORD\nd* was vpon Saul, as he sate in his house with his iauelin in his hand: and Dauid played with \add his\add* hand.
\v 10 And Saul sought to smite Dauid euen to the wall with the iauelin: but hee slipt away out of Sauls presence, and he smote the iauelin into the wall: and Dauid fled, and escaped that night.
\v 11 Saul also sent messengers vnto Dauids house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal Dauids wife tolde him, saying, If thou saue not thy life to night, to morrow thou shalt be slaine.
\v 12 ¶ So Michal let Dauid downe thorow a window: and hee went and fled, and escaped.
\v 13 And Michal tooke an image, and laid \add it\add* in the bedde, and put a pillow of goats haire for his bolster, and couered \add it\add* with a cloth.
\v 14 And when Saul sent messengers to take Dauid, she said, He \add is\add* sicke.
\v 15 And Saul sent the messengers againe to see Dauid, saying, Bring him vp to me in the bedde, that I may slay him.
\v 16 And when the messengers were come in, behold, \add there was\add* an image in the bed, with a pillow of goates haire for his bolster.
\v 17 And Saul said vnto Michal, Why hast thou deceiued me so, and sent away mine enemie, that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, Hee said vnto me, Let mee goe; Why should I kill thee?
\v 18 ¶ So Dauid fledde, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him: and hee and Samuel went, and dwelt in Naioth.
\v 19 And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, Dauid \add is\add* at Naioth in Ramah.
\v 20 And Saul sent messengers to take Dauid: and when they sawe the company of the Prophets prophecying, and Samuel standing \add as\add* appointed ouer them, the Spirit of God was vpon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophecied.
\v 21 And when it was tolde Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophecied likewise: and Saul sent messengers againe the third time, and they prophecied also.
\v 22 Then went hee also to Ramah, and came to a great well that \add is\add* in Sechu: and he asked, and said, Where \add are\add* Samuel and Dauid? And \add one\add* said, Behold, \add they be\add* at Naioth in Ramah.
\v 23 And hee went thither to Naioth in Ramah: and the Spirit of God was vpon him also, and he went on and prophecied vntill hee came to Naioth in Ramah:
\v 24 And he stript off his clothes also, and prophecied before Samuel in like manner, and \f + \fr 19:24 \ft Heb. fell.\f*lay downe naked all that day, and all that night: wherefore they say, \x + \xo 19:24 \xt Chap. 10.11.\x*\add Is\add* Saul also among the Prophets?
\c 20
\iex 1 Dauid consulteth with Ionathan for his safetie. 11 Ionathan and Dauid renew their couenant by oath. 18 Ionathans token to Dauid. 24 Saul missing Dauid, seeketh to kill Ionathan. 35 Ionathan louingly taketh his leaue of Dauid.
\v 1 ¶ And Dauid fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said before Ionathan, What haue I done? what \add is\add* mine iniquity? and what \add is\add* my sinne before thy father, that he seeketh my life?
\v 2 And he said vnto him, God forbid, thou shalt not die; beholde, my father will doe nothing, either great or small, but that he will \f + \fr 20:2 \ft Heb. vncouer mine eare.\f*shew it me: and why should my father hide this thing from me? it \add is\add* not \add so\add*.
\v 3 And Dauid sware moreouer, and said, Thy father certeinly knoweth that I haue found grace in thine eyes, and he sayth, Let not Ionathan know this, lest he be grieued: but truely, \add as\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liueth, and \add as\add* thy soule liueth, \add there is\add* but a step betweene me & death.
\v 4 Then said Ionathan vnto Dauid, \f + \fr 20:4 \ft Or, Say, what is thy mind, and I will doe, &c.\f*Whatsoeuer thy soule \f + \fr 20:4 \ft Heb. speaketh, or thinketh.\f*desireth, I will euen doe \add it\add* for thee.
\v 5 And Dauid said vnto Ionathan, Behold, to morrow \add is\add* the new moone, and I should not faile to sit with the king at meate: but let me goe, that I may hide my selfe in the fields vnto the third \add day\add* at euen.
\v 6 If thy father at all misse me, then say, Dauid earnestly asked \add leaue\add* of me that he might runne to Bethlehem his citie: for \add there is\add* a yeerely \f + \fr 20:6 \ft Or, feast.\f*sacrifice there for all the family.
\v 7 If he say thus, \add It is\add* well, thy seruant shall haue peace: but if he be very wroth, \add then\add* be sure that euill is determined by him.
\v 8 Therefore thou shalt deale kindly with thy seruant, for \x + \xo 20:8 \xt Chap. 18.3. and 23.18.\x*thou hast brought thy seruant into a couenant of the \nd LORD\nd* with thee: notwithstanding, if there be in me iniquitie, slay me thy selfe: for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father?
\v 9 And Ionathan said, Farre be it from thee: for if I knew certainely that euill were determined by my father to come vpon thee, then would not I tell it thee?
\v 10 Then said Dauid to Ionathan, Who shall tell me? or what \add if\add* thy father answere thee roughly?
\v 11 ¶ And Ionathan said vnto Dauid, Come, and let vs goe out into the field. And they went out both of them into the field.
\v 12 And Ionathan said vnto Dauid, O \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, when I haue \f + \fr 20:12 \ft Heb. searched.\f*sounded my father, about to morrow any time, \add or\add* the third \add day\add*, and behold, \add if there be\add* good toward Dauid, and I then send not vnto thee, and \f + \fr 20:12 \ft Heb. vncouer thine eare.\f*shew it thee;
\v 13 The \nd LORD\nd* doe so and much more to Ionathan: but if it please my father to doe thee euill, then I wil shew it thee, and send thee away, that thou mayest goe in peace, and the \nd LORD\nd* be with thee, as hee hath beene with my father.
\v 14 And thou shalt not onely while yet I liue, shew me the kindnesse of the \nd LORD\nd*, that I die not:
\v 15 But \add also\add* thou shalt not cut off thy kindnesse from my house for euer: no not when the \nd LORD\nd* hath cut off the enemies of Dauid, euery one from the face of the earth.
\v 16 So Ionathan \f + \fr 20:16 \ft Heb. cut.\f*made \add a couenant\add* with the house of Dauid, \add saying\add*, Let the \nd LORD\nd* euen require \add it\add* at the hande of Dauids enemies.
\v 17 And Ionathan caused Dauid to sweare againe, \f + \fr 20:17 \ft Or, by his loue towards him.\f*because he loued him: for he loued him as he loued his owne soule.
\v 18 Then Ionathan said to Dauid, To morrow \add is\add* the newe moone: and thou shalt be missed, because thy seat wil be \f + \fr 20:18 \ft Heb. missed\f*emptie.
\v 19 And \add when\add* thou hast stayed three dayes, \add then\add* thou shalt goe downe \f + \fr 20:19 \ft Or, diligently. Heb. greatly.\f*quickly, and come to the place where thou diddest hide thy selfe, \f + \fr 20:19 \ft Heb. in the day of the businesse.\f*when the businesse was \add in hand\add*, and shalt remaine by the stone \f + \fr 20:19 \ft Or, that sheweth the way.\f*Ezel.
\v 20 And I will shoot three arrowes on the side \add thereof\add*, as though I shot at a marke.
\v 21 And behold, I will send a ladde, \add saying\add*, Goe, find out the arrowes. If I expresly say vnto the lad, Behold, the arrowes \add are\add* on this side of thee, take them: then come thou, for \add there is\add* peace to thee, and \f + \fr 20:21 \ft Heb. not any thing.\f*no hurt, \add as\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liueth.
\v 22 But if I say thus vnto the yong man, Behold, the arrowes \add are\add* beyond thee: goe thy way, for the \nd LORD\nd* hath sent thee away.
\v 23 And \add as touching\add* the matter which thou and I haue spoken of, behold, the \nd LORD\nd* \add be\add* betweene thee and mee for euer.
\v 24 ¶ So Dauid hid himselfe in the field: and when the newe moone was come, the king sate him downe to eate meate.
\v 25 And the king sate vpon his seate, as at other times, \add euen\add* vpon a seate by the wall: and Ionathan arose, and Abner sate by Sauls side, and Dauids place was emptie.
\v 26 Neuerthelesse, Saul spake not any thing that day: for hee thought, Some thing hath befallen him, hee \add is\add* not cleane; surely he \add is\add* not cleane.
\v 27 And it came to passe on the morrow \add which was\add* the second \add day\add* of the moneth, that Dauids place was emptie: and Saul said vnto Ionathan his sonne, Wherefore commeth not the sonne of Iesse to meat, neither yesterday nor to day?
\v 28 And Ionathan answered Saul, Dauid earnestly asked \add leaue\add* of me, to goe to Bethlehem.
\v 29 And he said, Let me goe, I pray thee, for our familie hath a sacrifice in the citie, and my brother, hee hath commanded mee \add to be there\add*: and now if I haue found fauour in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren: Therefore he commeth not vnto the kings table.
\v 30 Then Sauls anger was kindled against Ionathan, and hee said vnto him, \f + \fr 20:30 \ft Or, thou peruerse rebell. Heb. sonne of peruerse rebellion.\f*Thou sonne of the peruerse rebellious \add woman\add*, doe not I know that thou hast chosen the sonne of Iesse to thine owne confusion, and vnto the confusion of thy mothers nakednesse?
\v 31 For as long as the sonne of Iesse liueth vpon the ground, thou shalt not be stablished, nor thy kingdome: wherefore now send and fetch him vnto mee, for he \f + \fr 20:31 \ft Heb. is the sonne of death.\f*shall surely die.
\v 32 And Ionathan answered Saul his father, and said vnto him, Wherefore shall hee be slaine? what hath hee done?
\v 33 And Saul cast a iauelin at him to smite him, whereby Ionathan knewe that it was determined of his father to slay Dauid.
\v 34 So Ionathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and did eate no meat the second day of the moneth: for hee was grieued for Dauid, because his father had done him shame.
\v 35 ¶ And it came to passe in the morning, that Ionathan went out into the field, at the time appointed with Dauid, and a little ladde with him.
\v 36 And he said vnto his lad, Runne, finde out now the arrowes which I shoote. \add And\add* as the ladde ranne, he shot an arrow \f + \fr 20:36 \ft Hebr. to passe ouer him.\f*beyond him.
\v 37 And when the ladde was come to the place of the arrow, which Ionathan had shot, Ionathan cryed after the ladde, and said, \add Is\add* not the arrow beyond thee?
\v 38 And Ionathan cryed after the ladde, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Ionathans ladde gathered vp the arrowes, and came to his master.
\v 39 But the lad knew not any thing: onely Ionathan and Dauid knew the matter.
\v 40 And Ionathan gaue his \f + \fr 20:40 \ft Heb. instruments.\f*artillery vnto \f + \fr 20:40 \ft Hebr. that was his.\f*his ladde, and said vnto him, Goe, cary \add them\add* to the citie.
\v 41 ¶ \add And\add* assoone as the ladde was gone, Dauid arose out of \add a place\add* toward the South, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himselfe three times: and they kissed one another, and wept one with another, vntill Dauid exceeded.
\v 42 And Ionathan said to Dauid, Goe in peace, \f + \fr 20:42 \ft Or, The \nd LORD\nd* be witnesse of that which, &c.\f*forasmuch as wee haue sworne both of vs in the Name of the \nd LORD\nd*, saying; The \nd LORD\nd* be betweene me and thee, and betweene my seede and thy seede for euer. And hee arose, and departed: and Ionathan went into the citie.
\c 21
\iex 1 Dauid at Nob, obtaineth of Ahimelech hallowed bread. 7 Doeg was present. 8 Dauid taketh Goliaths sword. 10 Dauid at Gath faineth himselfe madde.
\v 1 ¶ Then came Dauid to Nob, to Ahimelech the Priest, and Ahimelech was afraide at the meeting of Dauid, and said vnto him, Why \add art\add* thou alone, and no man with thee?
\v 2 And Dauid said vnto Ahimelech the Priest, The king hath commanded me a businesse, and hath said vnto me, Let no man know any thing of the businesse whereabout I send thee, and what I haue commanded thee: and I haue appointed \add my\add* seruants to such and such a place.
\v 3 Now therefore what is vnder thine hand? giue \add me\add* fiue \add loaues of\add* bread in mine hand, or what there is \f + \fr 21:3 \ft Heb. found.\f*present.
\v 4 And the Priest answered Dauid, and said, \add There is\add* no common bread vnder mine hand, but there is \x + \xo 21:4 \xt Exod. 25.30. leuit. 24.5. matt. 12.4.\x*hallowed bread: if the young men haue kept themselues at least from women.
\v 5 And Dauid answered the Priest, and said vnto him, Of a trueth women haue beene kept from vs about these three dayes, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and \add the bread is\add* in a manner common, \f + \fr 21:5 \ft Or, especially wh this day there is other sanctified in the vessell.\f*yea, though it were sanctified this day in the vessell.
\v 6 So the Priest gaue him hallowed \add bread\add*; for there was no bread there, but the Shewbread that was taken from before the \nd LORD\nd*, to put hote bread in the day when it was taken away.
\v 7 Now a certaine man of the seruants of Saul \add was\add* there that day, detained before the \nd LORD\nd*, and his name \add was\add* Doeg an Edomite, the chiefest of the heardmen that \add belonged\add* to Saul.
\v 8 ¶ And Dauid said vnto Ahimelech, And is there not here vnder thine hand speare or sword? for I haue neither brought my sword nor my weapons with mee, because the kings businesse required haste.
\v 9 And the Priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whome thou slewest in \x + \xo 21:9 \xt Chap. 17.2.\x*the valley of Elah, behold, it is heere wrapt in a cloth behinde the Ephod: if thou wilt take that, take it; for there is no other saue that, here. And Dauid saide, There is none like that, giue it me.
\v 10 ¶ And Dauid arose, and fled that day, for feare of Saul, and went to Achish, the king of Gath.
\v 11 And the seruants of Achish sayd vnto him, \add Is\add* not this Dauid the king of the land? Did they not sing one to another of him in daunces, saying, \x + \xo 21:11 \xt Chap. 18.7. and 29.5. ecclus. 47.6.\x*Saul hath slaine his thousands, and Dauid his ten thousands?
\v 12 And Dauid layd vp these wordes in his heart, and was sore afraid of Achish the king of Gath.
\v 13 And he changed his behauiour before them, and fained himselfe mad in their hands, and \f + \fr 21:13 \ft Or, made markes.\f*scrabled on the doores of the gate, and let his spittle fall downe vpon his beard.
\v 14 Then saide Achish vnto his seruants, Loe, you see the man \f + \fr 21:14 \ft Or, playeth the madman.\f*is mad: wherefore \add then\add* haue yee brought him to mee?
\v 15 Haue I need of mad-men, that ye haue brought this \add fellow\add* to play the mad-man in my presence? Shall this \add fellow\add* come into my house?
\c 22
\iex 1 Companies resort vnto Dauid at Adullam. 3 At Mizpeh he commendeth his parents vnto the King of Moab. 5 Admonished by Gad, hee commeth to Hareth. 6 Saul going to pursue him, complaineth of his seruants vnfaithfulnesse. 9 Doeg accuseth Ahimelech. 11 Saul cōmandeth to kil the Priests. 17 The footmen refusing, Doeg executeth it. 20 Abiathar escaping, bringeth Dauid the newes.
\v 1 ¶ Dauid therefore departed thence, and escaped to the caue Adullam: and when his brethren, and all his fathers house heard \add it\add*, they went downe thither to him.
\v 2 \f + \fr 22:2 \ft Hebr. had a creditour.\f*\f + \fr 22:2 \ft Hebr. bitter of soule.\f*And euery one \add that was\add* in distresse, and euery one that \add was\add* in debt, and euery one \add that was\add* discontented, gathered themselues vnto him, and he became a captaine ouer them: and there were with him about foure hundred men.
\v 3 ¶ And Dauid went thence to Mizpeh of Moab; and he said vnto the king of Moab, Let my father, and my mother, I pray thee, come foorth, \add and be\add* with you, till I know what God will doe for me.
\v 4 And he brought them before the king of Moab: and they dwelt with him all the while that Dauid was in the hold.
\v 5 ¶ And the Prophet Gad said vnto Dauid, Abide not in the hold; depart, and get thee into the land of Iudah. Then Dauid departed, and came into the forrest of Hareth.
\v 6 ¶ \f + \fr 22:6 \ft Or, groue in a hie place.\f*When Saul heard that Dauid was discouered, and the men that \add were\add* with him: (now Saul abode in Gibeah vnder a tree in Ramah, hauing his speare in his hand, and all his seruants \add were\add* standing about him.)
\v 7 Then Saul saide vnto his seruants that stood about him, Heare now, ye Beniamites: Will the sonne of Iesse giue euery one of you fields, and Uineyards, \add and\add* make you all captaines of thousands, and captaines of hundreds:
\v 8 \f + \fr 22:8 \ft Hebr. vncouereth mine eare.\f*That all of you haue conspired against me, and \add there is\add* none that sheweth mee, that my sonne hath made a league with the sonne of Iesse, and \add there is\add* none of you that is sory for me, or sheweth vnto me that my sonne hath stirred vp my seruant against me, to lye in wait, as at this day?
\v 9 ¶ Then answered Doeg the Edomite, (which was set ouer the seruants of Saul) and saide, I saw the sonne of Iesse comming to Nob, to Ahimelech the sonne of Ahitub.
\v 10 And hee enquired of the \nd LORD\nd* for him, and gaue him victuals, and gaue him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
\v 11 Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the Priest, the sonne of Ahitub, and all his fathers house, the Priests that \add were\add* in Nob: and they came all of them to the king.
\v 12 \f + \fr 22:12 \ft Hebr. behold me.\f*And Saul said, Heare now thou sonne of Ahitub: and hee answered, Here I \add am\add*, my lord.
\v 13 And Saul saide vnto him, Why haue ye conspired against me, thou and the sonne of Iesse, in that thou hast giuen him bread, and a sword, and hast enquired of God for him, that he should rise against mee, to lye in waite, as at this day?
\v 14 Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, And who \add is so\add* faithfull among all thy seruants, as Dauid, which is the kings sonne in law, and goeth at thy bidding, and is honourable in thine house?
\v 15 \f + \fr 22:15 \ft Hebr. litle or great.\f*Did I then beginne to enquire of God for him? be it farre from mee: let not the king impute \add any\add* thing vnto his seruant, \add nor\add* to all the house of my father: for thy seruant knew nothing of all this, lesse or more.
\v 16 And the king saide, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou, and all thy fathers house.
\v 17 ¶ \f + \fr 22:17 \ft Or, guard. Heb. the runners.\f*And the king said vnto the footmen that stood about him, Turne and slay the Priests of the \nd LORD\nd*, because their hand also \add is\add* with Dauid, and because they knew when he fled, and did not shew it to mee. But the seruants of the king would not put foorth their hand to fall vpon the Priestes of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 18 And the king said to Doeg, Turne thou and fall vpon the Priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned, and hee fell vpon the Priests, and slew on that day foure score and fiue persons that did weare a linnen Ephod.
\v 19 And Nob the citie of the Priests smote he with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings, and oxen and asses, and sheepe, with the edge of the sword.
\v 20 ¶ And one of the sonnes of Ahimelech, the sonne of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled after Dauid:
\v 21 And Abiathar shewed Dauid that Saul had slaine the \nd LORD\nd*s Priests.
\v 22 And Dauid said vnto Abiathar, I knew \add it\add* that day, when Doeg the Edomite \add was\add* there, that he would surely tell Saul: I haue occasioned \add the death\add* of all the persons of thy fathers house.
\v 23 Abide thou with me, feare not: for he that seeketh my life, seeketh thy life: but with me thou shalt bee in safegard.
\c 23
\iex 1 Dauid enquiring of the \nd LORD\nd* by Abiathar, rescueth Keilah. 7 God shewing him the comming of Saul and the trecherie of the Keilites, he escapeth from Keilah. 14 In Ziph Ionathan commeth and comforteth him. 19 The Ziphites discouer him to Saul. 25 At Maon he is rescued from Saul by the inuasion of the Philistines. 29 He dwelleth at En-gedi.
\v 1 ¶ Then they told Dauid, saying, Beholde, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshing floores.
\v 2 Therefore Dauid enquired of the \nd LORD\nd*, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Dauid, Goe, and smite the Philistines, and saue Keilah.
\v 3 And Dauids men said vnto him, Behold, we be afraid here in Iudah: how much more then if wee come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?
\v 4 Then Dauid enquired of the \nd LORD\nd* yet againe: And the \nd LORD\nd* answered him, and said, Arise, go down to Keilah: for I will deliuer the Philistines into thine hand.
\v 5 So Dauid and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistins, and brought away their cattell, and smote them with a great slaughter: so Dauid saued the inhabitants of Keilah.
\v 6 \x + \xo 23:6 \xt Chap. 22.20.\x*And it came to passe when Abiathar the sonne of Ahimelech fled to Dauid to Keilah, \add that\add* hee came downe \add with\add* an Ephod in his hand.
\v 7 ¶ And it was told Saul that Dauid was come to Keilah: and Saul said, God hath deliuered him into mine hand: for he is shut in, by entring into a towne that hath gates and barres.
\v 8 And Saul called all the people together to warre, to goe downe to Keilah, to besiege Dauid, and his men.
\v 9 ¶ And Dauid knewe that Saul secretly practised mischiefe against him, and hee said to Abiathar the Priest, Bring hither the Ephod.
\v 10 Then saide Dauid, O \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, thy seruant hath certainly heard that Saul seeketh to come to Keilah, to destroy the citie for my sake.
\v 11 Will the men of Keilah deliuer me vp into his hande? will Saul come downe, as thy seruant hath heard, O \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel? I beseech thee tell thy seruant. And the \nd LORD\nd* said, He will come downe.
\v 12 \f + \fr 23:12 \ft Hebr. shut vp.\f*Then said Dauid, Will the men of Keilah deliuer me, and my men, into the hand of Saul? And the \nd LORD\nd* said, They will deliuer \add thee\add* vp.
\v 13 ¶ Then Dauid and his men, \add which were\add* about sixe hundred, arose, and departed out of Keilah, and went whithersoeuer they could goe: and it was told Saul that Dauid was escaped from Keilah, and hee forbare to goe foorth.
\v 14 And Dauid abode in the wildernesse in strong holds, and remained in a mountaine in the wildernes of Ziph: and Saul sought him euery day, but God deliuered him not into his hand.
\v 15 And Dauid saw that Saul was come out to seeke his life: and Dauid \add was\add* in the wildernes of Ziph in a wood.
\v 16 ¶ And Ionathan Sauls sonne arose, & went to Dauid into the wood, and strengthened his hand in God.
\v 17 And he said vnto him, Feare not; for the hand of Saul my father shall not finde thee, and thou shalt be king ouer Israel, and I shall be next vnto thee: and that also Saul my father knoweth.
\v 18 And they two made a couenant before the \nd LORD\nd*: and Dauid abode in the wood, and Ionathan went to his house.
\v 19 ¶ \f + \fr 23:19 \ft Hebr. on the right hand.\f*\f + \fr 23:19 \ft Or, the wildernesse?\f*Then came vp the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doth not Dauid hide himselfe with vs in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which \add is\add* on the South of Ieshimon?
\v 20 Now therefore, O king, come downe according to all the desire of thy soule to come downe, and our part \add shall be\add* to deliuer him into the kings hand.
\v 21 And Saul said, Blessed \add be\add* yee of the \nd LORD\nd*, for yee haue compassion on me.
\v 22 \f + \fr 23:22 \ft Heb. foote shalbe.\f*Goe, I pray you, prepare yet, and know, and see his place where his haunt is, \add and\add* who hath seene him there: for it is told mee \add that\add* he dealeth very subtilly.
\v 23 See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himselfe, and come ye againe to me with the certainty, and I will goe with you: and it shall come to passe, if he be in the land, that I will search him out throughout all the thousands of Iudah.
\v 24 And they arose, & went to Ziph before Saul: but Dauid and his men \add were\add* in the wildernesse of Maon, in the plaine on the South of Ieshimon.
\v 25 Saul also and his men went to seeke \add him\add*, and they told Dauid: wherefore he came downe into a rocke, and abode in the wildernesse of Maon: and when Saul heard \add that\add*, he pursued after Dauid in the wildernes of Maon.
\v 26 And Saul went on this side of the mountaine, and Dauid and his men on that side of the mountaine: and Dauid made haste to get away for feare of Saul: for Saul and his men compassed Dauid and his men round about to take them.
\v 27 ¶ \f + \fr 23:27 \ft Hebr. spread themselues vpon &c.\f*But there came a messenger vnto Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come: for the Philistines haue inuaded the land.
\v 28 \f + \fr 23:28 \ft That is, the rocke of diuisions.\f*Wherefore Saul returned from pursuing after Dauid, & went against the Philistines; therefore they called that place Sela-Hammahlekoth.
\v 29 ¶ And Dauid went vp from thence, and dwelt in strong holds at En-gedi.
\c 24
\iex 1 Dauid in a caue at Engedi, hauing cut off Sauls skirt, spareth his life. 8 Hee sheweth thereby his innocencie. 16 Saul acknowledging his fault, taketh an oath of Dauid, and departeth.
\v 1 ¶ \f + \fr 24:1 \ft Heb. after.\f*And it came to passe when Saul was returned from folowing the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, Dauid \add is\add* in the wildernesse En-gedi.
\v 2 Then Saul tooke three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to secke Dauid and his men vpon the rockes of the wilde goates.
\v 3 And hee came to the sheepe coates by the way, where \add was\add* a caue, and Saul went in to couer his feete: and Dauid and his men remained in the sides of the caue.
\v 4 \f + \fr 24:4 \ft Hebr. the robe, which was Sauls.\f*And the men of Dauid sayd vnto him, Beholde the day of which the \nd LORD\nd* sayd vnto thee, Behold, I wil deliuer thine enemy into thine hand, that thou mayest doe to him as it shall seeme good vnto thee. Then Dauid arose, and cut off the skirt of Sauls robe priuily.
\v 5 And it came to passe afterward, that Dauids heart smote him, because he had cut off Sauls skirt.
\v 6 And hee sayd vnto his men, The \nd LORD\nd* forbid that I should doe this thing vnto my master the \nd LORD\nd*s Anoynted, to stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he \add is\add* the Anoynted of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 7 \f + \fr 24:7 \ft Hebr. cut off.\f*So Dauid stayed his seruants with these wordes, and suffered them not to rise against Saul: but Saul rose vp out of the caue, and went on \add his\add* way.
\v 8 Dauid also rose afterward, and went out of the caue, and cryed after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behinde him, Dauid stouped with his face to the earth, and bowed himselfe.
\v 9 ¶ And Dauid said to Saul, Wherfore hearest thou mens words, saying, Behold, Dauid seeketh thy hurt?
\v 10 Behold, this day thine eyes haue seene, how that the \nd LORD\nd* had deliuered thee to day into mine hand in the caue: and \add some\add* bade \add me\add* kill thee, but \add mine eye\add* spared thee, and I said, I will not put foorth mine hand against my lord, for hee \add is\add* the \nd LORD\nd*s Anointed.
\v 11 Moreouer my father, See, yea see the skirt of thy robe in my hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not, know thou and see, that \add there is\add* neither euill nor transgression in mine hand, and I haue not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soule, to take it.
\v 12 The \nd LORD\nd* iudge betweene me and thee, and the \nd LORD\nd* auenge me of thee: but mine hand shall not be vpon thee.
\v 13 As saith the prouerbe of the ancients, Wickednesse proceedeth from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be vpon thee.
\v 14 After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom doest thou pursue? After a dead dogge, after a flea.
\v 15 \f + \fr 24:15 \ft Heb. iudge\f*The \nd LORD\nd* therfore be Iudge, and iudge betweene me and thee, and see, and plead my cause, and deliuer me out of thine hand.
\v 16 ¶ And it came to passe when Dauid had made an ende of speaking these words vnto Saul, that Saul said, \add Is\add* this thy voice, my sonne Dauid? And Saul lift vp his voice, and wept.
\v 17 And he said to Dauid, Thou \add art\add* more righteous then I: for thou hast rewarded mee good, whereas I haue rewarded thee euill.
\v 18 \f + \fr 24:18 \ft Heb. shut vp.\f*And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me: forasmuch as when the \nd LORD\nd* had deliuered me into thine hand, thou killedst me not.
\v 19 For if a man finde his enemie, will hee let him goe well away? wherefore the \nd LORD\nd* reward thee good, for that thou hast done vnto me this day.
\v 20 And now behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be King, and that the kingdome of Israel shall be established in thine hand.
\v 21 Sweare now therefore vnto me by the \nd LORD\nd*, that thou wilt not cut off my seede after mee, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my fathers house.
\v 22 And Dauid sware vnto Saul, and Saul went home: but Dauid and his men gate them vp vnto the holde.
\c 25
\iex 1 Samuel dieth. 2 Dauid in Paran sendeth to Nabal. 10 Prouoked by Nabals churlishnesse, hee mindeth to destroy him. 14 Abigail vnderstanding thereof, 18 taketh a present, 23 and by her wisedome 32 pacifieth Dauid. 36 Nabal hearing thereof, dieth. 39 Dauid taketh Abigail and Ahinoam to be his wiues. 44 Michal is giuen to Phalti.
\v 1 ¶ \x + \xo 25:1 \xt Chap. 28.3. ecclus. 46.13, 20.\x*And Samuel died, and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And Dauid arose, & went downe to the wildernesse of Paran.
\v 2 \f + \fr 25:2 \ft Or, busines.\f*And \add there was\add* a man in Maon, whose possessions \add were\add* in Carmel, and the man \add was\add* very great, and hee had three thousand sheepe, and a thousand goates: and he was shearing his sheepe in Carmel.
\v 3 Now the name of the man \add was\add* Nabal, and the name of his wife, Abigail: and shee \add was\add* a woman of good vnderstanding, and of a beautifull countenance: but the man \add was\add* churlish and euill in his doings, and hee was of the house of Caleb.
\v 4 ¶ And Dauid heard in the wildernesse, that Nabal did sheare his sheepe.
\v 5 \f + \fr 25:5 \ft Heb. aske him in my name, of peace.\f*And Dauid sent out ten yong men, and Dauid said vnto the young men, Get you vp to Carmel, and goe to Nabal, and greete him in my name;
\v 6 And thus shall ye say to him that liueth in prosperitie, Peace \add be\add* both to thee, and peace \add be\add* to thine house, and peace \add be\add* vnto all that thou hast.
\v 7 \f + \fr 25:7 \ft Heb. shamed.\f*And now, I haue heard that thou hast shearers: now thy shepheards which were with vs, wee hurt them not, neither was there ought missing vnto them, all the while they were in Carmel.
\v 8 Aske thy yong men, and they will shew thee: wherefore let the yong men finde fauour in thine eyes: (for we come in a good day) giue, I pray thee, whatsoeuer commeth to thine hand, vnto thy seruants, and to thy sonne Dauid.
\v 9 \f + \fr 25:9 \ft Heb. rested.\f*And when Dauids yong men came, they spake to Nabal according to all those words in the name of Dauid, and ceased.
\v 10 ¶ And Nabal answered Dauids seruants, and said, Who \add is\add* Dauid? and who \add is\add* the sonne of Iesse? There bee many seruants now a daies that breake away euery man from his master.
\v 11 \f + \fr 25:11 \ft Hebr. slaughter.\f*Shall I then take my bread and my water, and my flesh that I haue killed for my shearers, and giue \add it\add* vnto men, whom I know not whence they \add bee\add*?
\v 12 So Dauids yong men turned their way, and went againe, and came and told him all those sayings.
\v 13 And Dauid said vnto his men, Gird you on euery man his sword. And they girded on euery man his sword, and Dauid also girded on his sword: and there went vp after Dauid about foure hundred men, and two hundred abode by the stuffe.
\v 14 ¶ \f + \fr 25:14 \ft Hebr. flew vpon them.\f*But one of the yong men told Abigail Nabals wife, saying, Behold, Dauid sent messengers out of the wildernesse to salute our master: and he railed on them.
\v 15 \f + \fr 25:15 \ft Heb. shamed.\f*But the men \add were\add* very good vnto vs, and we were not hurt, neither missed we any thing as long as wee were conuersant with them, when we were in the fields.
\v 16 They were a wall vnto vs both by night and day, all the while we were with them keeping sheepe.
\v 17 Now therefore know and consider what thou wilt doe: for euill is determined against our master, and against all his houshold: for he \add is such\add* a sonne of Belial, that \add a man\add* cannot speake to him.
\v 18 ¶ \f + \fr 25:18 \ft Or, lumps.\f*Then Abigail made haste, and tooke two hundred loaues, and two bottles of wine, and fiue sheepe readie dressed, and fiue measures of parched corne, and an hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figges, and laid \add them\add* on asses.
\v 19 And she said vnto her seruants, Goe on before me, behold, I come after you: but she told not her husband Nabal.
\v 20 And it was so as she rode on the asse, that she came downe by the couert of the hill, and behold, Dauid and his men came downe against her, and she met them.
\v 21 (Now Dauid had said, Surely in vaine haue I kept all that this \add fellow\add* hath in the wildernesse, so that nothing was missed of all that \add pertained\add* vnto him: and he hath requited me euil for good.
\v 22 So and more also doe God vnto the enemies of Dauid, if I leaue of all that pertaine to him by the morning light, any that pisseth against the wall.)
\v 23 And when Abigail saw Dauid, she hasted, and lighted off the asse, and fell before Dauid on her face, and bowed her selfe to the ground,
\v 24 \f + \fr 25:24 \ft Heb. eares\f*And fell at his feet, and said, Upon me, my lord, vpon me \add let this\add* iniquitie \add be\add*, and let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speake in thine audience, and heare the words of thine handmaid.
\v 25 \f + \fr 25:25 \ft Heb. lay it to his heart.\f*Let not my lord, I pray thee, regard this man of Belial, \add euen\add* Nabal: for as his name \add is\add*, so \add is\add* he: Nabal \add is\add* his name, and folly \add is\add* with him: But I thine handmaid saw not the yong men of my lord, whom thou didst send.
\v 26 \f + \fr 25:26 \ft Hebr. sauing thy selfe.\f*Now therefore, my lord, \add as\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liueth, and \add as\add* thy soule liueth, seeing the \nd LORD\nd* hath withholden thee from comming to \add shed\add* blood, and from auenging thy selfe with thine owne hand: now let thine enemies and they that secke euill to my lord, bee as Nabal.
\v 27 \f + \fr 25:27 \ft Or, present\f*\f + \fr 25:27 \ft Heb. walke at the feet of &c.\f*And now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought vnto my lord, let it euen be giuen vnto the yong men that follow my lord.
\v 28 I pray thee, forgiue the trespasse of thine handmaide: for the \nd LORD\nd* will certainely make my lord a sure house, because my lord fighteth the battels of the \nd LORD\nd*, and euill hath not bene found in thee \add all\add* thy dayes.
\v 29 \f + \fr 25:29 \ft Heb. in the midst of the bought of a sling.\f*Yet a man is risen to pursue thee, and to seeke thy soule: but the soule of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, and the soules of thine enemies, them shall he sling out, \add as out\add* of the middle of a sling.
\v 30 And it shall come to passe when the \nd LORD\nd* shal haue done to my lord, according to all the good that hee hath spoken concerning thee, and shall haue appointed thee ruler ouer Israel;
\v 31 \f + \fr 25:31 \ft Hebr. no staggering: or, stumbling.\f*That this shall bee no griefe vnto thee, nor offence of heart vnto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causelesse, or that my lord hath auenged himselfe: But when the \nd LORD\nd* shall haue dealt well with my lord, then remember thine handmayd.
\v 32 ¶ And Dauid sayd to Abigail, Blessed \add be\add* the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, which sent thee this day to meet me.
\v 33 And blessed \add bee\add* thy aduice, and blessed \add be\add* thou, which hast kept me this day from comming to \add shed\add* blood, and from auenging my selfe with mine owne hand.
\v 34 For in very deed, \add as\add* the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel liueth, which hath kept mee backe from hurting thee, except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me, surely there had not bene left vnto Nabal, by the morning light, any that pisseth against the wall.
\v 35 So Dauid receiued of her hand \add that\add* which shee had brought him, and sayd vnto her, Goe vp in peace to thine house; See, I haue hearkened to thy voyce, and haue accepted thy person.
\v 36 ¶ And Abigail came to Nabal, and behold, he held a feast in his house like the feast of a king; & Nabals heart was merry within him, for hee \add was\add* very drunken: wherefore shee tolde him nothing, lesse or more, vntill the morning light.
\v 37 But it came to passe in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became \add as\add* a stone.
\v 38 And it came to passe about ten dayes \add after\add*, that the \nd LORD\nd* smote Nabal, that he died.
\v 39 ¶ And when Dauid heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed \add be\add* the \nd LORD\nd*, that hath pleaded the cause of my reproch from the hand of Nabal, and hath kept his seruant from euil: for the \nd LORD\nd* hath returned the wickednesse of Nabal vpon his owne head. And Dauid sent, and communed with Abigail, to take her to him to wife.
\v 40 And when the seruants of Dauid were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spake vnto her, saying, Dauid sent vs vnto thee, to take thee to him to wife.
\v 41 And shee arose, and bowed her selfe on \add her\add* face to the earth, and sayd, Beholde, \add let\add* thine handmayd \add bee\add* a seruant to wash the feet of the seruants of my lord.

\c 26
\iex 1 Saul by the discouery of the Ziphites, commeth to Hachilah against Dauid. 4 Dauid comming into the trench, stayeth Abishai from killing Saul, but taketh his speare and cruse. 13 Dauid reprooueth Abner, 18 and exhorteth Saul. 21 Saul acknowledgeth his sinne.
\v 1 ¶ \x + \xo 26:1 \xt Chap.23.19.\x*And the Ziphites came vnto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doeth not Dauid hide himselfe in the hill of Hachilah, \add which is\add* before Ieshimon?
\v 2 Then Saul arose, and went downe to the wildernesse of Ziph, hauing three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seeke Dauid in the wildernesse of Ziph.
\v 3 And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which \add is\add* before Ieshimon by the way: but Dauid abode in the wildernesse, and he saw that Saul came after him into the wildernesse.
\v 4 Dauid therefore sent out spies, and vnderstood that Saul was come in very deed.
\v 5 ¶ \x + \xo 26:5 \xt Chap.14.50. and 17.55.\x*\f + \fr 26:5 \ft Or, midst of his carriages.\f*And Dauid arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched: and Dauid beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the sonne of Ner the captaine of his hoste: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.
\v 6 Then answered Dauid, and sayd to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Abishai the sonne of Zeruiah brother to Ioab, saying, Who will goe downe with me to Saul to the campe? And Abishai sayd, I will goe downe with thee.
\v 7 So Dauid and Abishai came to the people by night, and behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his speare stucke in the ground at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.
\v 8 \f + \fr 26:8 \ft Heb. shut vp.\f*Then said Abishai to Dauid, God hath deliuered thine enemie into thine hand this day: now therefore let mee smite him, I pray thee, with the speare, euen to the earth at once, and I will not \add smite\add* him the second time.
\v 9 And Dauid sayd to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch forth his hand against the \nd LORD\nd*s Anointed, and be guiltlesse?
\v 10 Dauid said furthermore, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liueth, the \nd LORD\nd* shal smite him, or his day shall come to die, or hee shall descend into battell, and perish.
\v 11 The \nd LORD\nd* forbid that I should stretch foorth mine hand against the \nd LORD\nd*s Anointed: but I pray thee, take thou now the speare that \add is\add* at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let vs goe.
\v 12 So Dauid tooke the speare and the cruse of water from Sauls bolster, and they gate them away, and no man saw \add it\add*, nor knew \add it\add*, neither awaked: for they \add were\add* all asleepe, because a deepe sleepe from the \nd LORD\nd* was fallen vpon them.
\v 13 ¶ Then Dauid went ouer to the other side, and stood on the toppe of an hill afarre off (a great space \add being\add* betweene them:)
\v 14 And Dauid cryed to the people, and to Abner the sonne of Ner, saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered, and sayd, Who \add art\add* thou \add that\add* cryest to the King?
\v 15 And Dauid said to Abner, \add Art\add* not thou a \add valiant\add* man? and who \add is\add* like to thee in Israel? Wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? for there came one of the people in, to destroy the king thy lord.
\v 16 \f + \fr 26:16 \ft Heb. the sonnes of death.\f*This thing is not good that thou hast done: as the \nd LORD\nd* liueth, ye are worthy to die, because yee haue not kept your master the \nd LORD\nd*s Anointed: and now see where the Kings speare is, and the cruse of water that was at his bolster.
\v 17 And Saul knew Dauids voyce, and said, \add Is\add* this thy voice, my sonne Dauid? And Dauid saide, \add It is\add* my voice, my lord, O king.
\v 18 And he said, Wherefore doeth my lord thus pursue after his seruant? for what haue I done? or what euill \add is\add* in mine hand?
\v 19 \f + \fr 26:19 \ft Heb. smell.\f*\f + \fr 26:19 \ft Heb. cleauing.\f*Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king heare the words of his seruant: If the \nd LORD\nd* haue stirred thee vp against mee, let him accept an offering: but if \add they be\add* the children of men, cursed \add be\add* they before the \nd LORD\nd*: for they haue driuen me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the \nd LORD\nd*, saying, Goe serue other gods.
\v 20 Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the \nd LORD\nd*: for the king of Israel is come out to seeke a flea, as when one doeth hunt a partridge in the mountaines.
\v 21 ¶ Then said Saul, I haue sinned: Returne, my sonne Dauid, for I will no more doe thee harme, because my soule was precious in thine eyes this day: behold, I haue played the foole, and haue erred exceedingly.
\v 22 And Dauid answered, and sayd, Behold the kings speare, and let one of the yong men come ouer and fetch it.
\v 23 The \nd LORD\nd* render to euery man his righteousnesse, and his faithfulnesse: for the \nd LORD\nd* deliuered thee into \add my\add* hand to day, but I would not stretch foorth mine hand against the \nd LORD\nd*s Anointed.
\v 24 And behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes: so let my life bee much set by in the eyes of the \nd LORD\nd*, and let him deliuer me out of all tribulation.
\v 25 Then Saul said to Dauid, Blessed \add be\add* thou, my sonne Dauid: thou shalt both doe great \add things\add*, and also shalt still preuaile. So Dauid went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.
\c 27
\iex 1 Saul hearing Dauid to be in Gath, seeketh no more for him. 5 Dauid beggeth Ziklag of Achish. 8 Hee inuading other countreys, perswadeth Achish he fought against Iudah.

\v 2 And Dauid arose, and hee passed ouer with the sixe hundred men that \add were\add* with him, vnto Achish the sonne of Maoch king of Gath.
\v 3 And Dauid dwelt with Achish at Gath, he, and his men, euery man with his houshold, \add euen\add* Dauid with his two wiues, Ahinoam the Iezreelitesse, and Abigail the Carmelitesse Nabals wife.
\v 4 And it was told Saul, that Dauid was fled to Gath, and he sought no more againe for him.
\v 5 ¶ And Dauid said vnto Achish, If I haue now found grace in thine eyes, let them giue mee a place in some towne in the countrey, that I may dwel there: for why should thy seruant dwell in the royall citie with thee?
\v 6 Then Achish gaue him Ziklag that day: wherfore Ziklag pertaineth vnto the kings of Iudah vnto this day.

\v 9 And Dauid smote the land, and left neither man nor woman aliue, and tooke away the sheepe, and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparell, and returned, and came to Achish.
\v 10 \f + \fr 27:10 \ft Or, did you not make a rode, &c.\f*And Achish said, Whither haue ye made a rode to day? And Dauid said, Against the South of Iudah, and against the South of the Ierahmeelites, and against the South of the Kenites.
\v 11 And Dauid saued neither man nor woman aliue, to bring \add tidings\add* to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on vs, saying, So did Dauid, and so \add will be\add* his maner, all the while he dwelleth in the countrey of the Philistines.

\iex 1 Achish putteth confidence in Dauid. 3 Saul hauing destroyed the witches, 4 and now in his feare forsaken of God, 7 seeketh to a witch. 9 The witch, encouraged by Saul, raiseth vp Samuel. 15 Saul hearing his ruine, fainteth. 21 The woman with his seruants refresh him with meate.
\v 1 ¶ And it came to passe in those dayes, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel: And Achish said vnto Dauid, Knowe thou assuredly, that thou shalt goe out with me to battell, thou, and thy men.
\v 2 And Dauid said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy seruant can doe. And Achish said to Dauid, Therfore will I make thee keeper of mine head for euer.
\v 3 ¶ \x + \xo 28:3 \xt Chap. 25.1.\x*Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, euen in his owne citie: and Saul had put away those that had familiar spirits, and the wyzards, out of the land.
\v 4 And the Philistines gathered themselues together, and came and pitched in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched in Gilboa.
\v 5 And when Saul saw the hoste of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled.
\v 6 And when Saul enquired of the \nd LORD\nd*, the \nd LORD\nd* answered him not, neither by dreames, nor by Urim, nor by Prophets.
\v 7 ¶ Then said Saul vnto his seruants, Seeke me a woman that hath a familiar spirit, that I may goe to her, and enquire of her. And his seruant said to him, Beholde, \add there is\add* a woman that hath a familiar spirit at Endor.
\v 8 And Saul disguised himselfe, and put on other raiment, and hee went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night, and he said, I pray thee diuine vnto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me \add him\add* vp whom I shall name vnto thee.
\v 9 And the woman saide vnto him, Beholde, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how hee hath cut off those that haue familiar spirits, and the wyzards out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?
\v 10 And Saul sware to her by the \nd LORD\nd*, saying, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liueth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.
\v 11 Then said the woman, Whome shall I bring vp vnto thee? and he said, Bring me vp Samuel.
\v 12 And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a lowd voyce; and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceiued me? for thou \add art\add* Saul.
\v 13 And the king sayd vnto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said vnto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.
\v 14 \f + \fr 28:14 \ft Hebr. what is his forme?\f*And he said vnto her, What forme \add is\add* he of? And she said, An old man commeth vp, and he \add is\add* couered with a mantle. And Saul perceiued that it \add was\add* Samuel, and hee stouped with \add his\add* face to the ground, and bowed himselfe.
\v 15 ¶ \f + \fr 28:15 \ft Hebr. by the hand of Prophets.\f*And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me vp? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistins make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by Prophets, nor by dreames: therefore I haue called thee, that thou mayst make knowen vnto me, what I shall doe.
\v 16 Then said Samuel, Wherefore then doest thou aske of mee, seeing the \nd LORD\nd* is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy?
\v 17 \f + \fr 28:17 \ft Or, for himselfe.\f*\x + \xo 28:17 \xt Chap. 15.28.\x*\f + \fr 28:17 \ft Hebr. mine hand.\f*And the \nd LORD\nd* hath done to him, as hee spake by mee: for the \nd LORD\nd* hath rent the kingdome out of thine hand, and giuen it to thy neighbour, \add euen\add* to Dauid:
\v 18 Because thou obeiedst not the voice of the \nd LORD\nd*, nor executedst his fierce wrath vpon Amalek, therefore hath the \nd LORD\nd* done this thing vnto thee this day.
\v 19 Moreouer, the \nd LORD\nd* will also deliuer Israel with thee, into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow \add shalt\add* thou and thy sonnes \add bee\add* with mee: the \nd LORD\nd* also shall deliuer the hoste of Israel into the hand of the Philistines.
\v 20 \f + \fr 28:20 \ft Heb. made haste and fel with the fulnesse of his stature.\f*Then Saul fell straightway all along on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel, & there was no strength in him: for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor al the night.
\v 21 ¶ And the woman came vnto Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and sayd vnto him, Behold, thine handmayd hath obeyed thy voice, and I haue put my life in my hand, and haue hearkened vnto thy words which thou spakest vnto me:
\v 22 Now therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also vnto the voyce of thine handmaid, & let me set a morsel of bread before thee; & eat, that thou mayest haue strength, when thou goest on thy way.
\v 23 But hee refused, and said, I will not eate. But his seruants together with the woman compelled him, and he hearkened vnto their voyce: so he arose from the earth, & sate vpon the bed.
\v 24 And the woman had a fat calfe in the house, and she hasted, and killed it, and tooke flower and kneaded \add it\add*, and did bake vnleauened bread thereof.
\v 25 And she brought \add it\add* before Saul, and before his seruants, and they did eate: then they arose vp, and went away that night.

\iex 1 Dauid marching with the Philistines, 3 is disalowed by their Princes. 6 Achish dismisseth him with commendations of his fidelity.
\v 1 ¶ Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek: and the Israelites pitched by a fountaine which \add is\add* in Iezreel.
\v 2 And the lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands: but Dauid and his men passed on in the rere-ward with Achish.
\v 3 Then said the princes of the Philistines, What doe these Hebrewes \add here\add*? And Achish said vnto the princes of the Philistines, \add Is\add* not this Dauid the seruant of Saul the king of Israel, which hath bene with me these dayes, or these yeeres, and I haue found no fault in him since he fell vnto me, vnto this day?
\v 4 \x + \xo 29:4 \xt 1.Chron. 12.19.\x*And the princes of the Philistines were wroth with him, and the princes of the Philistines said vnto him, Make this fellow returne, that he may goe againe to his place which thou hast appointed him, and let him not go downe with vs to battel, lest in the battell he be an aduersary to vs: for wherewith should hee reconcile himselfe vnto his master? \add should it\add* not \add be\add* with the heads of these men?
\v 5 \x + \xo 29:5 \xt Chap. 18.7. and 21.11.\x*\add Is\add* not this Dauid, of whom they sang one to another in daunces, saying, Saul slew his thousands, and Dauid his ten thousands?
\v 6 ¶ \f + \fr 29:6 \ft Hebr. thou art not good in the eyes of the lords.\f*Then Achish called Dauid, and said vnto him, Surely, \add as\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liueth, thou hast bene vpright, and thy going out and thy comming in with me in the hoste \add is\add* good in my sight: for I haue not found euil in thee, since the day of thy comming vnto me vnto this day: neuertheles, the lords fauour thee not.
\v 7 \f + \fr 29:7 \ft Hebr. doe not euill in the eyes of the lords.\f*Wherefore now returne and goe in peace, that thou displease not the lords of the Philistines.
\v 8 ¶ \f + \fr 29:8 \ft Hebr. before thee.\f*And Dauid said vnto Achish, But what haue I done? and what hast thou found in thy seruant so long as I haue bene with thee vnto this day, that I may not goe fight against the enemies of my lord the king?
\v 9 And Achish answered, and said to Dauid, I know that thou \add art\add* good in my sight, as an Angel of God: notwithstanding the Princes of the Philistines haue said, Hee shall not goe vp with vs to the battell.
\v 10 Wherfore now rise vp early in the morning, with thy masters seruants that are come with thee: and assoone as yee be vp early in the morning, and haue light, depart.
\v 11 So Dauid and his men rose vp early to depart in the morning, to returne into the land of the Philistines; and the Philistines went vp to Iezreel.

\iex 1 The Amalekites spoile Ziklag. 4 Dauid asking counsell, is encouraged by God to pursue them. 11 By the meanes of a reuiued Egyptian, he is brought to the enemies, and recouereth all the spoile. 22 Dauids law to diuide the spoile equally betweene them that fight, and them that keepe the stuffe. 26 He sendeth presents to his friends.
\v 1 ¶ And it came to passe when Dauid and his men were come to Ziklag on the third day, that the Amalekites had inuaded the South and Ziklag, and smitten Ziklag, and burnt it with fire:
\v 2 And had taken the women captiues, that \add were\add* therein; they slewe not any either great or smal, but caried \add them\add* away, and went on their way.
\v 3 ¶ So Dauid and his men came to the citie, and beholde, \add it was\add* burnt with fire, and their wiues, and their sonnes, and their daughters were taken captiues.
\v 4 Then Dauid and the people that \add were\add* with him, lift vp their voice, and wept, vntill they had no more power to weepe.
\v 5 And Dauids two wiues were taken captiues, Ahinoam the Iezreelitesse, and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
\v 6 \f + \fr 30:6 \ft Heb. bitter.\f*And Dauid was greatly distressed: for the people spake of stoning him, because the soule of all the people was grieued, euery man for his sonnes, and for his daughters: but Dauid encouraged himselfe in the \nd LORD\nd* his God.
\v 7 And Dauid said to Abiathar the Priest Ahimelechs sonne, I pray thee, bring mee hither the Ephod: and Abiathar brought thither the Ephod to Dauid.
\v 8 And Dauid enquired at the \nd LORD\nd*, saying; Shall I pursue after this troupe? shall I ouertake them? And he answered him, Pursue, for thou shalt surely ouertake \add them\add*, and without faile recouer \add all\add*.
\v 9 So Dauid went, hee, and the sixe hundred men that \add were\add* with him, and came to the brooke Besor, where those that were left behinde, stayed.
\v 10 But Dauid pursued, he and foure hundred men: (for two hundred abode behinde, which were so faint that they could not goe ouer the brooke Besor.)
\v 11 ¶ And they found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to Dauid, and gaue him bread, and he did eate, and they made him drinke water.
\v 12 And they gaue him a piece of a cake of figges, and two clusters of raisins: and when hee had eaten, his spirit came againe to him: for hee had eaten no bread, nor drunke \add any\add* water, three dayes and three nights.
\v 13 And Dauid sayde vnto him, To whome \add belongest\add* thou? and whence \add art\add* thou? And he said, I \add am\add* a yong man of Egypt, seruant to an Amalekite, and my master left me, because three dayes agone I fell sicke.
\v 14 Wee made an inuasion vpon the South of the Cherethites, and vpon \add the coast\add* which \add belongeth\add* to Iudah, and vpon the South of Caleb, and wee burnt Ziklag with fire.
\v 15 And Dauid sayde to him, Canst thou bring me downe to this company? And he said, Sweare vnto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me, nor deliuer mee into the handes of my master, and I will bring thee downe to this company.
\v 16 ¶ And when he had brought him downe, behold, \add they were\add* spread abroad vpon all the earth, eating and drinking, and dauncing, because of all the great spoile that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Iudah.
\v 17 \f + \fr 30:17 \ft Heb. their morrow.\f*And Dauid smote them from the twilight, euen vnto the euening of the next day: and there escaped not a man of them, saue foure hundred yong men which rode vpon camels, and fled.
\v 18 And Dauid recouered all that the Amalekites had caried away: and Dauid rescued his two wiues.
\v 19 And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great, neither sonnes nor daughters, neither spoile, nor any \add thing\add* that they had taken to them: Dauid recouered all.
\v 20 And Dauid tooke all the flockes, and the herds, \add which\add* they draue before those \add other\add* cattell, and said, This \add is\add* Dauids spoile.
\v 21 ¶ \f + \fr 30:21 \ft Or, asked them howe they did.\f*And Dauid came to the two hundred men which were so faint that they could not follow Dauid, whome they had made also to abide at the brook Besor: and they went forth to meet Dauid, and to meete the people, that \add were\add* with him; and when Dauid came neere to the people, he saluted them.
\v 22 \f + \fr 30:22 \ft Heb. men.\f*Then answered all the wicked men, and \add men\add* of Belial, of those that went with Dauid, and said, Because they went not with vs, we wil not giue them \add ought\add* of the spoile, that wee haue recouered, saue to euery man his wife and his children, that they may leade \add them\add* away, and depart.
\v 23 Then said Dauid, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the \nd LORD\nd* hath giuen vs, who hath preserued vs, and deliuered the companie that came against vs, into our hand.
\v 24 For who will hearken vnto you in this matter? But as his part \add is\add* that goeth downe to the battell, so \add shall\add* his part \add bee\add* that tarieth by the stuffe: they shall part alike.
