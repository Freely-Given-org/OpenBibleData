\iex 1 The genealogie of Christ from Abraham to Ioseph. 18 Hee was conceiued by the holy Ghost, and borne of the Virgin Mary when she was espoused to Ioseph. 19 The Angel satisfieth the misdeeming thoughts of Ioseph, and interpreteth the names of Christ.
\v 1 ¶ The booke of the \x + \xo 1:1 \xt Luke 3.23.\x*generation of Iesus Christ, the sonne of Dauid, the sonne of Abraham.
\v 2 \x + \xo 1:2 \xt Gen. 21.3.\x*Abraham begate Isaac, and \x + \xo 1:2 \xt Gene. 25.26.\x*Isaac begate Iacob, and \x + \xo 1:2 \xt Gen. 29.35.\x*Iacob begate Iudas and his brethren.
\v 3 And \x + \xo 1:3 \xt Gen. 38.27.\x*Iudas begate Phares and Zara of Thamar, and \x + \xo 1:3 \xt 1.Chro. 2.5. ruth. 4.18.\x*Phares begate Esrom, and Esrom begate Aram.
\v 4 And Aram begate Aminadab, and Aminadab begate Naasson, and Naasson begate Salmon.
\v 5 And Salmon begat Boos of Rachab, and Boos begate Obed of Ruth, and Obed begate Iesse.
\v 6 And \x + \xo 1:6 \xt 1.Sam. 16.1. and 17.12.\x*Iesse begate Dauid the King, & \x + \xo 1:6 \xt 2.Sam. 12.24.\x*Dauid the King begat Solomon of her that had bin the wife of Urias.
\v 7 And \x + \xo 1:7 \xt 1.Chro. 3.10.\x*Solomon begat Roboam, and Roboam begate Abia, and Abia begate Asa.
\v 8 And Asa begate Iosaphat, and Iosaphat begate Ioram, and Ioram begate Ozias.
\v 9 And Ozias begat Ioatham, and Ioatham begate Achas, and Achas begate Ezekias.
\v 10 And \x + \xo 1:10 \xt 2.King. 20.21. 1.Chro. 3.13.\x*Ezekias begate Manasses, and Manasses begate Amon, and Amon begate Iosias.
\v 11 And \f + \fr 1:11 \ft Some read, Iosias begate Iakim, and Iakim begat Iechonias.\f*Iosias begate Iechonias and his brethren, about the time they were caried away to Babylon.
\v 12 And after they were brought to Babylon, \x + \xo 1:12 \xt 1.Chro. 3.16,17.\x*Iechonias begat Salathiel, and Salathiel begate Zorobabel.
\v 13 And Zorobabel begat Abiud, and Abiud begat Eliakim, and Eliakim begate Azor.
\v 14 And Azor begat Sadoc, & Sadoc begat Achim, and Achim begat Eliud.
\v 15 And Eliud begate Eleazar, and Eleazar begate Matthan, and Matthan begate Iacob.
\v 16 And Iacob begate Ioseph the husband of Mary, of whom was borne Iesus, who is called Christ.
\v 17 So all the generations from Abraham to Dauid, \add are\add* fourteene generations: and from Dauid vntill the carying away into Babylon, \add are\add* foureteene generations: and from the carying away into Babylon vnto Christ, \add are\add* fourteene generations.
\v 18 ¶ Now the \x + \xo 1:18 \xt Luke 1.27.\x*birth of Iesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Ioseph (before they came together) shee was found with childe of the holy Ghost.
\v 19 Then Ioseph her husband being a iust \add man\add*, and not willing to make her a publique example, was minded to put her away priuily.
\v 20 But while hee thought on these things, behold, the Angel of the Lord appeared vnto him in a dreame, saying, Ioseph thou sonne of Dauid, feare not to take vnto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceiued in her, is of the holy Ghost.
\v 21 And she shall bring forth a sonne, \x + \xo 1:21 \xt Luke 1.31.\x*and thou shalt call his Name Iesus: for hee shall saue his people from their sinnes.
\v 22 (Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet, saying,
\v 23 \x + \xo 1:23 \xt Esai. 7.14.\x*Behold, a Uirgin shall be with childe, and shall bring foorth a sonne, and \f + \fr 1:23 \ft Or, his name shall be called.\f*they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted, is, God with vs.)
\v 24 Then Ioseph, being raised from sleepe, did as the Angel of the Lord had bidden him, & tooke vnto him his wife:
\v 25 And knewe her not, till shee had brought forth her first borne sonne, and he called his name Iesus.

\iex 1 The Wise men out of the East, are directed to Christ by a Starre. 11 They worship him, and offer their presents. 14 Ioseph fleeth into Egypt, with Iesus and his mother. 16 Herod slayeth the children: 20 Himselfe dyeth. 23 Christ is brought backe againe into Galilee to Nazareth.
\v 1 ¶ Now when \x + \xo 2:1 \xt Luk. 2.6.\x*Iesus was borne in Bethlehem of Iudea, in the dayes of Herod the king, behold, there came Wise men from the East to Hierusalem,
\v 2 Saying, Where is he that is borne King of the Iewes? for we haue seene his Starre in the East, and are come to worship him.
\v 3 When Herod the king had heard \add these things\add*, he was troubled, and all Hierusalem with him.
\v 4 And when he had gathered all the chiefe Priests and Scribes of the people together, hee demanded of them where Christ should be borne.
\v 5 And they said vnto him, In Bethlehem of Iudea: For thus it is written by the Prophet;
\v 6 \x + \xo 2:6 \xt Mic. 5.2. iohn 7.41.\x*And thou Bethlehem \add in\add* the land of Iuda, art not the least among the Princes of Iuda: for out of thee shall come a Gouernour, that shall \f + \fr 2:6 \ft Or, feede.\f*rule my people Israel.
\v 7 Then Herod, when he had priuily called the Wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the Starre appeared:
\v 8 And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Goe, and search diligently for the yong child, and when ye haue found \add him\add*, bring me word againe, that I may come and worship him also.
\v 9 When they had heard the King, they departed, and loe, the Starre which they saw in the East, went before them, till it came and stood ouer where the young childe was.
\v 10 When they saw the Starre, they reioyced with exceeding great ioy.
\v 11 ¶ And when they were come into the house, they saw the yong child with Mary his mother, and fell downe, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they \f + \fr 2:11 \ft Or, offered.\f*presented vnto him gifts, gold, and frankincense, and myrrhe.
\v 12 And being warned of God in a dreame, that they should not returne to Herode, they departed into their owne countrey another way.
\v 13 And when they were departed, behold, the Angel of the Lord appeareth to Ioseph in a dreame, saying, Arise and take the young childe, and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and bee thou there vntill I bring thee word: for Herode will seeke the young childe, to destroy him.
\v 14 When he arose, he tooke the yong childe and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:
\v 15 And was there vntill the death of Herode, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet, saying, \x + \xo 2:15 \xt Ose. 11.1.\x*Out of Egypt haue I called my sonne.
\v 16 ¶ Then Herode, when hee saw that hee was mocked of the Wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent foorth, and slewe all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two yeeres olde and vnder, according to the time, which he had diligently enquired of the Wise men.
\v 17 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by \x + \xo 2:17 \xt Ier. 31.15.\x*Ieremie the Prophet, saying,
\v 18 In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping \add for\add* her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.
\v 19 ¶ But when Herode was dead, behold, an Angel of the Lord appeareth in a dreame to Ioseph in Egypt,
\v 20 Saying, Arise, and take the yong childe and his mother, and goe into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the yong childes life.
\v 21 And he arose, and tooke the yong childe and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.
\v 22 But when he heard that Archelaus did reigne in Iudea in the roome of his father Herod, hee was afraid to goe thither: notwithstanding, beeing warned of God in a dreame, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:
\v 23 And hee came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophets, He shalbe called a Nazarene.

\iex 1 Iohn preacheth: his office: life, and Baptisme. 7 He reprehendeth the Pharises, 13 and baptizeth Christ in Iordane.
\v 1 ¶ In those daies came \x + \xo 3:1 \xt Marke 1.4. luke 3.2.\x*Iohn the Baptist, preaching in the wildernesse of Iudea,
\v 2 And saying, Repent yee: for the kingdome of heauen is at hand.
\v 3 For this is he that was spoken of by the Prophet Esaias, saying, \x + \xo 3:3 \xt Esay 40.3. marke 1.3.\x*The voyce of one crying in the wildernes, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
\v 4 And the same Iohn had his raiment of camels haire, and a leatherne girdle about his loynes, and his meate was locusts and wilde hony.
\v 5 Then went out to him Hierusalem, and all Iudea, and all the region round about Iordane,
\v 6 And were baptized of him in Iordane, confessing their sinnes.
\v 7 ¶ But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his Baptisme, he said vnto them, \x + \xo 3:7 \xt Cha. 12.34.\x*O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
\v 8 Bring forth therefore fruits \f + \fr 3:8 \ft Or, answerable to amendment of life.\f*meet for repentance.
\v 9 And thinke not to say within your selues, \x + \xo 3:9 \xt Iohn 18.39.\x*Wee haue Abraham to \add our\add* father: For I say vnto you, that God is able of these stones to raise vp children vnto Abraham.
\v 10 And now also the axe is layd vnto the root of the trees: \x + \xo 3:10 \xt Chap. 7.19.\x*Therefore euery tree which bringeth not foorth good fruite, is hewen downe, and cast into the fire.
\v 11 \x + \xo 3:11 \xt Mark. 1.8. iohn 1.26. luke 3.16.\x*I indeed baptize you with water vnto repentance: but he that commeth after mee, is mightier then I, whose shooes I am not worthy to beare, hee shall baptize you with the holy Ghost, and \add with\add* fire.
\v 12 Whose fanne \add is\add* in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floore, and gather his wheat into the garner: but wil burne vp the chaffe with vnquenchable fire.
\v 13 ¶ \x + \xo 3:13 \xt Mark. 1.9. luke 3.21.\x*Then commeth Iesus from Galilee to Iordane, vnto Iohn, to be baptized of him:
\v 14 But Iohn forbade him, saying, I haue need to bee baptized of thee, and commest thou to me?
\v 15 And Iesus answering, said vnto him, Suffer \add it to be so\add* now: for thus it becommeth vs to fulfill all righteousnesse. Then he suffered him.
\v 16 And Iesus, when hee was baptized, went vp straightway out of the water: and loe, the heauens were opened vnto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a doue, and lighting vpon him.
\v 17 And loe, a voice from heauen, saying, This is my beloued Sonne, in whom I am well pleased.

\iex 1 Christ fasteth, and is tempted. 11 The Angels minister vnto him. 13 Hee dwelleth in Capernaum, 17 beginneth to preach, 18 calleth Peter, and Andrew, 21 Iames, and Iohn: 23 and healeth all the diseased.
\v 1 ¶ Then was \x + \xo 4:1 \xt Marke 1.12. luke 4.1.\x*Iesus led vp of the Spirit into the wildernesse, to bee tempted of the deuill.
\v 2 And when hee had fasted forty dayes and forty nights, hee was afterward an hungred.
\v 3 And when the tempter came to him, hee said, If thou be the sonne of God, command that these stones bee made bread.
\v 4 But he answered, and said, It is written, \x + \xo 4:4 \xt Deut. 8.3.\x*Man shall not liue by bread alone, but by euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.
\v 5 Then the deuill taketh him vp into the holy Citie, and setteth him on a pinacle of the Temple,
\v 6 And saith vnto him, If thou bee the Sonne of God, cast thy selfe downe: For it is written, \x + \xo 4:6 \xt Psal. 91.11.\x*He shall giue his Angels charge concerning thee, & in \add their\add* handes they shall beare thee vp, lest at any time thou dash thy foote against a stone.
\v 7 Iesus said vnto him, It is written againe, \x + \xo 4:7 \xt Deu. 6.16.\x*Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
\v 8 Againe the Deuill taketh him vp into an exceeding high mountaine, and sheweth him all the kingdomes of the world, and the glory of them:
\v 9 And saith vnto him, All these things will I giue thee, if thou wilt fall downe and worship me.
\v 10 Then saith Iesus vnto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is written, \x + \xo 4:10 \xt Deu. 6.13 and 10.20.\x*Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him onely shalt thou serue.
\v 11 Then the deuill leaueth him, and behold, Angels came and ministred vnto him.
\v 12 ¶ \x + \xo 4:12 \xt Mar. 1.14. luke 4.14. iohn 4.43.\x*Now when Iesus had heard that Iohn was cast into prison, he departed into Galilee.
\v 13 And leauing Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is vpon the Sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthali:
\v 14 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the Prophet, saying,
\v 15 \x + \xo 4:15 \xt Esai. 9.1.\x*The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthali, \add by\add* the way of the Sea beyond Iordane, Galilee of the Gentiles:
\v 16 The people which sate in darkenesse, saw great light: and to them which sate in the region and shadow of death, light is sprung vp.
\v 17 ¶ \x + \xo 4:17 \xt Mar. 1.14\x*From that time Iesus began to preach, and to say, Repent, for the kingdome of heauen is at hand.
\v 18 ¶ \x + \xo 4:18 \xt Mar. 1.16.\x*And Iesus walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon, called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the Sea (for they were fishers)
\v 19 And he saith vnto them, Follow mee: and I will make you fishers of men.
\v 20 And they straightway left \add their\add* nets, and followed him.
\v 21 And going on from thence, hee sawe other two brethren, Iames \add the sonne\add* of Zebedee, and Iohn his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets: and he called them.
\v 22 And they immediatly left the shippe and their father, and followed him.
\v 23 ¶ And Iesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their Synagogues, and preaching the Gospel of the kingdome, and healing all maner of sickenesse, and all maner of disease among the people.
\v 24 And his fame went thorowout all Syria: and they brought vnto him all sicke people that were taken with diuerse diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with deuils, and those which were lunaticke, and those that had the palsie, and he healed them.
\v 25 And there followed him great great multitudes of people, from Galilee, and \add from\add* Decapolis, and \add from\add* Hierusalem, and \add from\add* Iudea, and \add from\add* beyond Iordane.

\iex Christ beginneth his Sermon in the Mount: 3 declaring who are blessed, 13 who are the salt of the earth, 14 the light of the world, the citie on an hill, 15 the candle: 17 that he came to fulfill the Law: 21 what it is to kill, 27 to commit adulterie, 33 to sweare: 38 Exhorteth to suffer wrong, 44 to loue euen our enemies, 38 and to labour after perfectnesse.
\v 1 ¶ And seeing the multitudes, he went vp into a mountaine: and when he was set, his disciples came vnto him.
\v 2 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,
\v 3 \x + \xo 5:3 \xt Luk. 6.20.\x*Blessed \add are\add* the poore in spirit: for theirs is the kingdome of heauen.
\v 4 Blessed \add are\add* they that mourne: for they shall be comforted.

\v 7 Blessed \add are\add* the mercifull: for they shall obtaine mercie.
\v 8 \x + \xo 5:8 \xt Psal. 24.4.\x*Blessed \add are\add* the pure in heart: for they shall see God.

\v 10 \x + \xo 5:10 \xt 1.Pet. 3.14.\x*Blessed \add are\add* they which are persecuted for righteousnesse sake: for theirs is the kingdome of heauen.
\v 11 Blessed are ye, when \add men\add* shall reuile \add you\add*, and persecute you, and shal say all manner of \x + \xo 5:11 \xt 1.Pet. 4.14.\x*euill against you \f + \fr 5:11 \ft Gr. lying.\f*falsly for my sake.
\v 12 Reioyce, and be exceeding glad: for great \add is\add* your reward in heauen: For so persecuted they the Prophets which were before you.
\v 13 ¶ Yee are the salt of the earth: \x + \xo 5:13 \xt Marke 9.50. luke. 14.34.\x*But if the salt haue lost his sauour, wherewith shall it bee salted? It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be troden vnder foote of men.
\v 14 Yee are the light of the world. A citie that is set on an hill, cannot be hid.
\v 15 Neither doe men \f + \fr 5:15 \ft The word in the originall signifieth a measure containing about a pint lesse then a pecke.\f*light a candle, and put it vnder a \x + \xo 5:15 \xt Marke 4.21 luke 8.16. and 11.33.\x*bushell: but on a candlesticke, and it giueth light vnto all that are in the house.
\v 16 Let your light so shine before men, \x + \xo 5:16 \xt 1.Pet. 2.12.\x*that they may see your good workes, and glorifie your father which is in heauen.
\v 17 ¶ Thinke not that I am come to destroy the lawe or the Prophets. I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.
\v 18 For verily I say vnto you, \x + \xo 5:18 \xt Luke 16.17.\x*Till heauen and earth passe, one iote or one title, shall in no wise passe from the law, till all be fulfilled.
\v 19 \x + \xo 5:19 \xt Iames 2.10.\x*Whosoeuer therfore shall breake one of these least commaundements, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdome of heauen: but whosoeuer shall doe, and teach \add them\add*, the same shall be called great in the kingdome of heauen.
\v 20 For I say vnto you, That except your righteousnesse shall exceede the righteousnesse of the Scribes and Pharisees, yee shall in no case enter into the kingdome of heauen.
\v 21 ¶ Yee haue heard, that it was saide \f + \fr 5:21 \ft Or, to them\f*by them of old time, \x + \xo 5:21 \xt Exod. 20.13. deut. 5.17.\x*Thou shalt not kill: and, Whosoeuer shall kill, shalbe in danger of the iudgement.
\v 22 But I say vnto you, that whosoeuer is angry with his brother without a cause, shall be in danger of the Iudgement: and whosoeuer shall say to his brother, Racha, shal be in danger of the counsell: but whosoeuer shall say, Thou foole, shalbe in danger of hell fire.
\v 23 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there remembrest that thy brother hath ought against thee:
\v 24 Leaue there thy gift before the altar, and goe thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.

\v 26 Uerily I say vnto thee, thou shalt by no meanes come out thence, till thou hast payd the vttermost farthing.
\v 27 ¶ Yee haue heard that it was said by them of old time, \x + \xo 5:27 \xt Exod. 20.14.\x*Thou shalt not commit adulterie.
\v 28 But I say vnto you, That whosoeuer looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adulterie with her already in his heart.
\v 29 \x + \xo 5:29 \xt Chap. 18.8. marke 9.47.\x*And if thy right eie \f + \fr 5:29 \ft Or, doe cause thee to offend.\f*offend thee, plucke it out, and cast \add it\add* from thee. For it is profitable for thee \add that\add* one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.
\v 30 And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast \add it\add* from thee. For it is profitable for thee \add that\add* one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.
\v 31 It hath beene said, \x + \xo 5:31 \xt Deut. 24.1. luke 16.18. 1.cor. 7.10.\x*Whosoeuer shall put away his wife, let him giue her a writing of diuorcement.
\v 32 But I say vnto you, that whosoeuer shall put away his wife, sauing for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoeuer shall marie her that is diuorced, committeth adulterie.
\v 33 ¶ Againe, yee haue heard that it hath beene said by them of old time, \x + \xo 5:31 \xt Deut. 24.1. luke 16.18. 1.cor. 7.10.\x*Thou shalt not forsweare thy selfe, but shalt performe vnto the Lord thine othes.
\v 34 But I say vnto you, Sweare not at all, neither by heauen, for it is Gods throne:
\v 35 Nor by the earth, for it is his footstoole: neither by Hierusalem, for it is the citie of the great king.
\v 36 Neither shalt thou sweare by thy head, because thou canst not make one haire white or blacke.
\v 37 \x + \xo 5:37 \xt Iam. 5.12.\x*But let your communication bee Yea, yea: Nay, nay: For whatsoeuer is more then these, commeth of euill.

\v 39 But I say vnto you, \x + \xo 5:39 \xt Luke 6.29. rom. 12.17. 1.cor. 6.7.\x*that yee resist not euill: but whosoeuer shall smite thee on thy right cheeke, turne to him the other also.
\v 40 And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coate, let him haue \add thy\add* cloake also.
\v 41 And whosoeuer shall compell thee to goe a mile, goe with him twaine.
\v 42 Giue to him that asketh thee: and \x + \xo 5:42 \xt Deut. 15.8.\x*from him that would borrow of thee, turne not thou away.
\v 43 ¶ Yee haue heard, that it hath beene said, \x + \xo 5:43 \xt Leuit. 19.18.\x*Thou shalt loue thy neighbour, and hate thine enemie:

\v 45 That yee may be the children of your father which is in heauen: for he maketh his sunne to rise on the euill and on the good, and sendeth raine on the iust, and on the vniust.
\v 46 \x + \xo 5:46 \xt Luke 6.32.\x*For if yee loue them which loue you, what reward haue yee? Doe not euen the Publicanes the same?

\v 48 Be yee therefore perfect, euen as your father, which is in heauen, is perfect.

\iex 1 Christ continueth his Sermon in the Mount, speaking of almes, 5 prayer, 14 forgiuing our brethren, 16 fasting, 19 where our treasure is to be layed vp, 24 of seruing God, and Mammon, 25 Exhorteth not to bee carefull for worldly things: 33 but to seeke Gods kingdome.
\v 1 ¶ Take heed that yee doe not your almes before men, to bee seene of them: otherwise yee haue no reward \f + \fr 6:1 \ft Or, with.\f*of your father which is in heauen.
\v 2 Therefore, \x + \xo 6:2 \xt Rom. 12.8\x*when thou doest \add thine\add* almes, \f + \fr 6:2 \ft Or, cause not a trumpet to be sounded.\f*doe not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites doe, in the Synagogues, and in the streetes, that they may haue glory of men. Uerily, I say vnto you, they haue their reward.
\v 3 But when thou doest almes, let not thy left hand know, what thy right doeth:
\v 4 That thine almes may be in secret: And thy father which seeth in secret, himselfe shall reward thee openly.
\v 5 ¶ And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites \add are\add*: for they loue to pray standing in the Synagogues, and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seene of men. Uerily I say vnto you, they haue their reward.
\v 6 But thou when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy doore, pray to thy father which is in secret, and thy father which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.
\v 7 But when yee pray, vse not vaine \x + \xo 6:7 \xt Ecclus. 7.16.\x*repetitions, as the heathen doe. For they thinke that they shall be heard for their much speaking.
\v 8 Be not yee therefore like vnto them: For your father knoweth what things yee haue neede of, before yee aske him.
\v 9 After this maner therefore pray yee: \x + \xo 6:9 \xt Luke 11.2.\x*Our father which art in heauen, hallowed be thy name.
\v 10 Thy kingdome come. Thy will be done, in earth, as \add it is\add* in heauen.

\v 17 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face:
\v 18 That thou appeare not vnto men to fast, but vnto thy father which is in secret: and thy father which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.

\v 22 \x + \xo 6:22 \xt Luke 11.34.\x*The light of the body is the eye: If therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shalbe full of light.

\v 24 ¶ \x + \xo 6:24 \xt Luke 16.13.\x*No man can serue two masters: for either he will hate the one and loue the other, or else hee will holde to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serue God and Mammon.
\v 25 Therfore I say vnto you, \x + \xo 6:25 \xt Luke 12.22. psal. 55.22. 1.pet. 5.7.\x*Take no thought for your life, what yee shall eate, or what ye shall drinke, nor yet for your body, what yee shall put on: Is not the life more then meate? and the body then raiment?
\v 26 Behold the foules of the aire: for they sow not, neither do they reape, nor gather into barnes, yet your heauenly father feedeth them. Are yee not much better then they?
\v 27 Which of you by taking thought, can adde one cubite vnto his stature?
\v 28 And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lillies of the field, how they grow: they toile not, neither doe they spinne.
\v 29 And yet I say vnto you, that euen Solomon in all his glory, was not arayed like one of these.
\v 30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grasse of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the ouen: \add shall he\add* not much more \add clothe\add* you, O yee of little faith?
\v 31 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eate? or, what shall we drinke? or wherewithall shall wee be clothed?
\v 32 (For after all these things doe the Gentiles seeke:) for your heauenly father knoweth that ye haue neede of all these things.
\v 33 But seeke ye first the kingdome of God, and his righteousnesse, and all these things shalbe added vnto you.
\v 34 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of it selfe: sufficient vnto the day \add is\add* the euill thereof.

\iex 1 Christ ending his Sermon in the Mount, reprooueth rash iudgement, 6 Forbiddeth to cast holy things to dogges, 7 Exhorteth to prayer, 13 To enter in at the strait gate, 15 To beware of false prophets, 21 Not to be hearers, but doers of the word: 24 like houses builded on a rocke, 26 And not on the sand.
\v 1 ¶ Iudge \x + \xo 7:1 \xt Luk.6.37. rom.2.1.\x*not, that ye be not iudged.

\v 3 \x + \xo 7:3 \xt Luk. 6.41.\x*And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye, but considerest not the beame that is in thine owne eye?

\v 8 For euery one that asketh, receiueth: and he that seeketh, findeth: and to him that knocketh, it shalbe opened.
\v 9 Or what man is there of you, whom if his sonne aske bread, will hee giue him a stone?

\v 8 The Centurion answered, and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come vnder my roofe: but speake the word onely, and my seruant shalbe healed.

\v 10 When Iesus heard \add it\add*, he marueiled, and said to them that followed, Uerely, I say vnto you, I haue not found so great faith, no not in Israel.

\iex 1 Christ reprooueth the blindnesse of the Pharisees concerning the breach of the Sabbath, 3 by Scriptures, 9 by reason, 13 and by a miracle. 22 He healeth the man possessed that was blind, and dumbe. 31 Blasphemie against the holy Ghost shall neuer be forgiuen. 36 Account shalbe made of idle words. 38 He rebuketh the vnfaithfull, who seeke after a signe: 49 and sheweth who is his brothe, sister, and mother.
\v 1 ¶ At that time, \x + \xo 12:1 \xt Marke 2.23. luke 6.1. deut. 23.25.\x*Iesus went on the Sabbath day thorow the corne, & his Disciples were an hungred, and beganne to pluck the eares of corne, and to eate.
\v 2 But when the Pharises saw \add it\add*, they said vnto him, Behold, thy Disciples doe that which is not lawfull to doe vpon the Sabbath day.
\v 3 But he said vnto them, Haue yee not read \x + \xo 12:3 \xt 1.Sam. 21.6.\x*what Dauid did when hee was an hungred, and they that were with him,

\v 10 ¶ And behold, there was a man which had his hand withered, and they asked him, saying, Is it lawfull to heale on the Sabbath dayes? that they might accuse him.
\v 11 And hee said vnto them, What man shal there be among you, that shall haue one sheepe: and if it fall into a pit on the Sabbath day, will hee not lay hold on it, and lift \add it\add* out?
\v 12 How much then is a man better then a shepe? Wherfore it is lawfull to doe well on the Sabbath dayes.
\v 13 Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand: and hee stretched \add it\add* forth, and it was restored whole, like as the other.
\v 14 ¶ Then the Pharises went out, and \f + \fr 12:14 \ft Or, tooke counsell.\f*held a counsell against him, how they might destroy him.
\v 15 But when Iesus knew \add it\add*, hee withdrew himselfe from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all,
\v 16 And charged them that they should not make him knowen:
\v 17 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the Prophet, saying,
\v 18 \x + \xo 12:18 \xt Esai. 42.1.\x*Behold, my seruant whom I haue chosen, my beloued in whom my soule is well pleased: I will put my spirit vpon him, and he shall shew iudgement to the Gentiles.
\v 19 He shall not striue, nor cry, neither shall any man heare his voice in the streets.
\v 20 A bruised reed shal he not breake, and smoking flaxe shall he not quench, till he send forth iudgment vnto victory.
\v 21 And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.
\v 22 ¶ \x + \xo 12:22 \xt Luke 11.14.\x*Then was brought vnto him one possessed with a deuill, blinde, and dumbe: and hee healed him, insomuch that the blinde and dumbe both spake and saw.

\v 24 \x + \xo 12:24 \xt Cha. 9.34\x*But when the Pharisees heard \add it\add*, they said, This \add fellow\add* doeth not cast out deuils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the deuils.
\v 25 And Iesus knew their thoughts, and said vnto them, Euery kingdome diuided against it selfe, is brought to desolation: and euery citie or house diuided against it selfe, shall not stand.
\v 26 And if Satan cast out Satan, he is diuided against himselfe; how shall then his kingdome stand?
\v 27 And if I by Beelzebub cast out deuils, by whom doe your children cast \add them\add* out? Therefore they shall be your Iudges.
\v 28 But if I cast out deuils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdome of God is come vnto you.

\v 30 He that is not with me, is against me: and hee that gathereth not with me, scattereth abroad.
\v 31 ¶ Wherefore I say vnto you, \x + \xo 12:31 \xt Mar. 3.28. luke 12.10. 1.iohn 5.16.\x*All maner of sinne and blasphemie shall be forgiuen vnto men: but the blasphemie against the \add holy\add* Ghost, shall not bee forgiuen vnto men.
\v 32 And whosoeuer speaketh a word against the sonne of man, it shall be forgiuen him: but whosoeuer speaketh against the holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiuen him, neither in this world, neither in the \add world\add* to come.
\v 33 Either make the tree good, and his fruit good: Or else make the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: For the tree is knowen by \add his\add* fruit.

\v 35 A good man out of the good treasure of the heart, bringeth foorth good things: and an euill man out of the euill treasure, bringeth foorth euill things.
\v 36 But I say vnto you, That euery idle word that men shall speake, they shall giue accompt thereof in the day of Iudgement.

\iex 3 The parable of the Sower, and the seed: 18 the exposition of it. 24 The parable of the tares, 31 of the mustardseed, 33 of the leuen, 44 of the hidden treasure, 45 of the pearle, 47 of the drawnet cast into the Sea, 53 And how Christ is contemned of his own countrymen.
\v 1 ¶ The same day went Iesus out of the house, \x + \xo 13:1 \xt Mark. 4.1.\x*and sate by the sea side.
\v 2 And great multitudes were gathered together vnto him, so that hee went into a ship, and sate, and the whole multitude stood on the shore.
\v 3 And hee spake many things vnto them in parables, saying, \x + \xo 13:3 \xt Luke 8.5.\x*Behold, a sower went foorth to sow.
\v 4 And when he sowed, some seedes fell by the wayes side, and the foules came, and deuoured them vp.
\v 5 Some fell vpon stony places, where they had not much earth: and foorth with they sprung vp, because they had no deepenesse of earth.
\v 6 And when the Sunne was vp, they were scorched: and because they had not root, they withered away.
\v 7 And some fell among thorns: and the thornes sprung vp, & choked them.
\v 8 But other fell into good ground, and brought foorth fruit, some an hundred folde, some sixtie folde, some thirty folde.
\v 9 Who hath eares to heare, let him heare.
\v 10 And the disciples came, and sayd vnto him, Why speakest thou vnto them in parables?
\v 11 He answered, and said vnto them, Because it is giuen vnto you to know the mysteries of the kingdome of heauen, but to them it is not giuen.
\v 12 \x + \xo 13:12 \xt Chap. 25.29.\x*For whosoeuer hath, to him shall be giuen, and he shall haue more abundance: but whosoeuer hath not, from him shall be taken away, euen that hee hath.
\v 13 Therefore speake I to then in parables: because they seeing, see not: and hearing, they heare not, neither doe they vnderstand.
\v 14 And in them is fulfilled the prophecie of Esaias, which saith, \x + \xo 13:14 \xt Esai 6.9. mark. 4.12. luke 8.10. ioh. 12.40. acts 28.26. rom. 11.8.\x*By hearing ye shall heare, and shall not vnderstand: and seeing yee shall see, and shall not perceiue.
\v 15 For this peoples heart is waxed grosse, and \add their\add* eares are dull of hearing, and \add their\add* eyes they haue closed, lest at any time they should see with \add their\add* eyes, and heare with \add their\add* eares, and should vnderstand with their heart, and should be conuerted, and I should heale them.
\v 16 But blessed \add are\add* your eyes, for they see: and your eares, for they heare.
\v 17 For verely I say vnto you, \x + \xo 13:17 \xt Luke 10.24.\x*that many Prophets, and righteous \add men\add* haue desired to see \add those things\add* which yee see, and haue not seene \add them\add*: and to heare \add those things\add* which ye heare, and haue not heard \add them\add*.
\v 18 ¶ Heare ye therefore the parable of the sower.
\v 19 When any one heareth the word of the kingdome, and vnderstandeth \add it\add* not, then commeth the wicked \add one\add*, and catcheth away that which was sowen in his heart: this is hee which receiued seede by the way side.
\v 20 But he that receiued the seed into stony places, the same is he that heareth the word, & anon with ioy receiueth it:
\v 21 Yet hath hee not root in himselfe, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.
\v 22 He also that receiued seed among the thorns, is he that heareth the word, and the care of this world, and the deceitfulnesse of riches choke the word, and he becommeth vnfruitfull.
\v 23 But he that receiued seed into the good ground, is hee that heareth the word, and vnderstandeth \add it\add*, which also beareth fruit, and bringeth foorth, some an hundred fold, some sixtie, some thirty.
\v 24 ¶ Another parable put he forth vnto them, saying; The kingdome of heauen is likened vnto a man which sowed good seed in his field:
\v 25 But while men slept, his enemy came & sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.
\v 26 But when the blade was sprung vp, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also.
\v 27 So the seruants of the housholder came, and said vnto him, Sir, didst not thou sow good seede in thy field? from whence then hath it tares?
\v 28 He said vnto them, An enemy hath done this. The seruants said vnto him, Wilt thou then that we goe and gather them vp?
\v 29 But he said, Nay: lest while yee gather vp the tares, ye root vp also the wheat with them.
\v 30 Let both grow together vntil the haruest: and in the time of haruest, I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and binde them in bundels to burne them: but gather the wheat into my barne.
\v 31 ¶ Another parable put he foorth vnto them, saying, \x + \xo 13:31 \xt Mar. 4.30. luke 13.19.\x*The kingdome of heauen is like to a graine of mustard seed, which a man tooke, and sowed in his field.
\v 32 Which indeed is the least of al seeds: but when it is growen, it is the greatest among herbes, and becommeth a tree: so that the birds of the aire come and lodge in the branches thereof.
\v 33 ¶ \x + \xo 13:33 \xt Luke 13.20.\x*Another parable spake he vnto them, The kingdome of heauen is like vnto leauen, which a woman tooke, and hid in three \f + \fr 13:33 \ft The worde in the Greek is a measure conteining about a peck and an halfe, wanting litle more then a pinte.\f*measures of meale, till the whole was leauened.
\v 34 \x + \xo 13:34 \xt Marke 4.33.\x*All these things spake Iesus vnto the multitude in parables, and without a parable spake hee not vnto them:
\v 35 That it might bee fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet, saying, \x + \xo 13:35 \xt Psal. 78.2.\x*I will open my mouth in parables, I wil vtter things which haue bin kept secret from the foundation of the world.
\v 36 Then Iesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and his disciples came vnto him, saying, Declare vnto vs the parable of the tares of the field.
\v 37 He answered, and said vnto them, Hee that soweth the good seed, is the sonne of man.
\v 38 The field is the world. The good seed, are the children of the kingdome: but the tares are the children of the wicked \add one\add*.
\v 39 The enemie that sowed them, is the deuill. \x + \xo 13:39 \xt Ioel. 3.13. reue 14.15.\x*The haruest, is the ende of the world. And the reapers are the Angels.
\v 40 As therefore the tares are gathered and burnt in the fire: so shall it be in the end of this world.
\v 41 The Sonne of man shall send forth his Angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdome all \f + \fr 13:41 \ft Or, scandales.\f*things that offend, and them which doe iniquitie:
\v 42 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wayling and gnashing of teeth.
\v 43 \x + \xo 13:43 \xt Dan. 12.3\x*Then shall the righteous shine foorth as the Sunne, in the kingdome of their father. Who hath eares to heare, let him heare.
\v 44 ¶ Againe, the kingdome of heauen is like vnto treasure hid in a field: the which when a man hath found, hee hideth, and for ioy thereof goeth and selleth all that hee hath, and buyeth that field.
\v 45 ¶ Againe, the kingdome of heauen is like vnto a marchant man, seeking goodly pearles:
\v 46 Who when hee had found one pearle of great price, he went and solde all that he had, and bought it.
\v 47 ¶ Againe, the kingdome of heauen is like vnto a net that was cast into the sea, and gathered of euery kind,
\v 48 Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sate downe, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.
\v 49 So shall it be at the ende of the world: the Angels shal come forth, and seuer the wicked from among the iust,
\v 50 And shal cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing, and gnashing of teeth.
\v 51 Iesus saith vnto them, Haue ye vnderstood all these things? They say vnto him, Yea, Lord.
\v 52 Then said he vnto them, Therefore euery Scribe \add which is\add* instructed vnto the kingdom of heauen, is like vnto a man \add that is\add* an housholder, which bringeth foorth out of his treasure \add things\add* new and old.
\v 53 ¶ And it came to passe, \add that\add* when Iesus had finished these parables, hee departed thence.
\v 54 \x + \xo 13:54 \xt Marke 6.1. luke. 4.16.\x*And when hee was come into his owne countrey, he taught them in their Synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this \add man\add* this wisedome, and \add these\add* mighty works?
\v 55 \x + \xo 13:55 \xt Ioh. 6.42.\x*Is not this the Carpenters sonne? Is not his mother called Marie? and his brethren, Iames, and Ioses, and Simon, and Iudas?
\v 56 And his sisters, are they not all with vs? whence then hath this \add man\add* all these things?
\v 57 And they were offended in him. But Iesus said vnto them, \x + \xo 13:57 \xt Mar. 6.4. luke 4.24. iohn 4.44.\x*A Prophet is not without honour, saue in his owne countrey, and in his owne house.
\v 58 And hee did not many mighty workes there, because of their vnbeliefe.

\v 1 ¶ At that time \x + \xo 14:1 \xt Marke 6.14. luke 9.7.\x*Herod the Tetrarch heard of the fame of Iesus,

\v 3 ¶ \x + \xo 14:3 \xt Luke 3.19.\x*For Herode had layd hold on Iohn, and bound him, and put \add him\add* in prison for Herodias sake, his brother Philips wife.
\v 4 For Iohn said vnto him, \x + \xo 14:4 \xt Leuit. 18.16. and 20.21.\x*It is not lawfull for thee to haue her.
\v 5 And when he would haue put him to death, hee feared the multitude, \x + \xo 14:5 \xt Chap. 21.26.\x*because they counted him as a Prophet.
\v 6 But when Herods birth day was kept, the daughter of Herodias daunced before them, and pleased Herode.
\v 7 Whereupon he promised with an oath, to giue her whatsoeuer she would aske.
\v 8 And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Giue me heere Iohn Baptists head in a charger.
\v 9 And the king was sorie: neuerthelesse for the othes sake, and them which sate with him at meate, he commanded \add it\add* to be giuen \add her\add*:
\v 10 And he sent, and beheaded Iohn in the prison.
\v 11 And his head was brought in a charger, and giuen to the Damsell: and she brought \add it\add* to her mother.
\v 12 And his Disciples came, and took vp the body, and buried it, and went and told Iesus.
\v 13 ¶ \x + \xo 14:13 \xt Marke 6.32. luke 9.10.\x*When Iesus heard \add of it\add*, he departed thence by ship, into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard \add thereof\add*, they followed him on foote, out of the cities.
\v 14 And Iesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was mooued with compassion toward them, and he healed their sicke.
\v 15 ¶ \x + \xo 14:15 \xt Iohn 6.5. marke 6.35.\x*And when it was euening, his Disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may goe into the villages, and buy themselues victuals.
\v 16 But Iesus said vnto them, They neede not depart; giue yee them to eate.
\v 17 And they say vnto him, We haue heere but fiue loaues, and two fishes.
\v 18 He said, Bring them hither to me.
\v 19 And hee commanded the multitude to sit downe on the grasse, & tooke the fiue loaues, and the two fishes, and looking vp to heauen, hee blessed, and brake, and gaue the loaues to \add his\add* Disciples, and the Disciples to the multitude.
\v 20 And they did all eat, & were filled: and they tooke vp of the fragments that remained twelue baskets full.
\v 21 And they that had eaten, were about fiue thousand men, beside women and children.
\v 22 ¶ And straightway Iesus constrained his Disciples to get into a ship, and to goe before him vnto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.
\v 23 \x + \xo 14:23 \xt Marke 6.46.\x*And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went vp into a mountaine apart to pray: \x + \xo 14:23 \xt Iohn 6.16.\x*and when the euening was come, he was there alone:
\v 24 But the ship was now in the midst of the Sea, tossed with waues: for the wind was contrary.
\v 25 And in the fourth watch of the night, Iesus went vnto them, walking on the Sea.
\v 26 And when the Disciples saw him walking on the Sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit: and they cried out for feare.
\v 27 But straightway Iesus spake vnto them, saying, Be of good cheere: it is I, be not afraid.
\v 28 And Peter answered him, and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come vnto thee on the water.
\v 29 And he said, Come. And when Peter was come downe out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Iesus.
\v 30 But when he saw the wind \f + \fr 14:30 \ft Or, strong.\f*boysterous, he was afraid: and beginning to sinke, he cried, saying, Lord saue me.
\v 31 And immediately Iesus stretched foorth \add his\add* hand, and caught him, and said vnto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?
\v 32 And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.
\v 33 Then they that were in the ship, came and worshipped him, saying, Of a trueth thou art the sonne of God.
\v 34 ¶ \x + \xo 14:34 \xt Marke 6.53.\x*And when they were gone ouer, they came into y\sup e\sup* land of Genesaret.
\v 35 And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that countrey round about, and brought vnto him al that were diseased,
\v 36 And besought him, that they might onely touch the hemme of his garment; and as many as touched, were made perfectly whole.

\iex 3 Christ reprooueth the Scribes, and Pharisees, for transgressing Gods Commaundements through their owne traditions: 11 teacheth how that which goeth into the mouth, doeth not defile a man. 21 He healeth the daughter of the woman of Canaan, 30 and other great multitudes: 32 and with seuen loaues and a few little fishes feedeth foure thousand men, beside women and children.
\v 1 ¶ Then \x + \xo 15:1 \xt Mark. 7.1.\x*came to Iesus Scribes and Pharisees, which were of Hierusalem, saying,
\v 2 Why do thy disciples transgresse the tradition of the Elders? for they wash not their handes when they eat bread.
\v 3 But hee answered, and said vnto them, Why doe you also transgresse the Commandement of God by your tradition?
\v 4 For God commaunded, saying, \x + \xo 15:4 \xt Exod. 20.12. deut. 5.16.\x*Honour thy father and mother: And \x + \xo 15:4 \xt Exod. 21.17. leui. 20.9. pro. 20.20.\x*hee that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.

\v 7 Yee hypocrites, well did Esaias prophecie of you, saying,
\v 8 \x + \xo 15:8 \xt Esa. 29.14.\x*This people draweth nigh vnto mee with their mouth, and honoureth mee with \add their\add* lips: but their heart is farre from me.
\v 9 But in vaine they do worship me, teaching \add for\add* doctrines, the commandements of men.
\v 10 ¶ \x + \xo 15:10 \xt Marke 7.14.\x*And he called the multitude, and said vnto them, Heare and vnderstand.
\v 11 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man: but that which commeth out of the mouth, this defileth a man.
\v 12 Then came his disciples, and said vnto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended after they heard this saying?
\v 13 But he answered and said, \x + \xo 15:13 \xt Ioh. 15.2.\x*Euery plant which my heauenly father hath not planted, shalbe rooted vp.
\v 14 Let them alone: \x + \xo 15:14 \xt Luke 6.39.\x*they be blinde leaders of the blinde. And if the blinde lead the blinde, both shall fall into the ditch.
\v 15 \x + \xo 15:15 \xt Mar. 7.17.\x*Then answered Peter, and said vnto him, Declare vnto vs this parable.
\v 16 And Iesus said, Are yee also yet without vnderstanding?
\v 17 Doe not yee yet vnderstand, that whatsoeuer entreth in at the mouth, goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?
\v 18 But those things which proceed out of the mouth, come forth from the heart, and they defile the man.
\v 19 \x + \xo 15:19 \xt Gen. 6.5. and 8.21.\x*For out of the heart proceed euill thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witnes, blasphemies.
\v 20 These are \add the things\add* which defile a man: But to eate with vnwashen hands, defileth not a man.
\v 21 ¶ \x + \xo 15:21 \xt Marke 7.24.\x*Then Iesus went thence, and departed into the coastes of Tyre and Sidon.
\v 22 And behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, & cried vnto him, saying, Haue mercy on me, O Lord, \add thou\add* sonne of Dauid, my daughter is grieuously vexed with a deuill.
\v 23 But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came, and besought him, saying, Send her away, for she cryeth after vs.
\v 24 But he answered, and said, \x + \xo 15:24 \xt Chap. 10.6.\x*I am not sent, but vnto the lost sheepe of the house of Israel.
\v 25 Then came she, and worshipped him, saying, Lord, helpe me.
\v 26 But he answered, and said, It is not meete to take the childrens bread, and to cast \add it\add* to dogs.
\v 27 And she said, Trueth Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crummes which fall from their masters table.
\v 28 Then Iesus answered, and said vnto her, O woman, great \add is\add* thy faith: be it vnto thee euen as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from that very houre.
\v 29 \x + \xo 15:29 \xt Marke 7.31.\x*And Iesus departed frō thence, and came nigh vnto the sea of Galile, and went vp into a mountaine, and sate downe there.

\v 31 Insomuch that the multitude wondred, when they saw the dumbe to speake, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walke, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.
\v 32 ¶ \x + \xo 15:32 \xt Mark. 8.1.\x*Then Iesus called his disciples \add vnto him\add*, and said, I haue compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three dayes, and haue nothing to eate: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.
\v 33 And his disciples say vnto him, Whence should we haue so much bread in the wildernesse, as to fill so great a multitude?
\v 34 And Iesus saith vnto them, How many loaues haue yee? And they said, Seuen, and a few little fishes.
\v 35 And hee commaunded the multitude to sit downe on the ground.
\v 36 And he tooke the seuen loaues and the fishes, and gaue thankes, and brake \add them\add*, and gaue to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
\v 37 And they did all eate, and were filled: and they tooke vp of the broken meate that was left, seuen baskets full.
\v 38 And they that did eat, were foure thousand men, beside women and children.
\v 39 And he sent away the multitude, and tooke ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.

\iex 1 The Pharises require a signe. 6 Iesus warneth his disciples of the leauen of the Pharises and Sadduces. 13 The peoples opinion of Christ, 16 and Peters confession of him. 21 Iesus foresheweth his death, 23 Reproouing Peter for disswading him from it: 24 And admonisheth those that will follow him, to beare the Crosse.
\v 1 ¶ The \x + \xo 16:1 \xt Mar. 8.11. luke 12.54.\x*Pharises also, with the Sadduces, came, and tempting, desired him that hee would shew them a signe from heauen.
\v 2 He answered, and said vnto them, When it is euening, yee say, It will bee faire weather: for the skie is red.
\v 3 And in the morning, \add It will be\add* foule weather to day: for the skie is red and lowring. O \add ye\add* hypocrites, yee can discerne the face of the skie, but can ye not discerne the signes of the times?
\v 4 A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a signe, and there shall no signe be giuen vnto it, but the signe of the Prophet Ionas. And hee left them, and departed.
\v 5 And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.
\v 6 ¶ Then Iesus said vnto them, Take heed and beware of the leauen of the Pharises, and of the Sadduces.
\v 7 And they reasoned among themselues, saying, \add It is\add* because we haue taken no bread.
\v 8 \add Which\add* when Iesus perceiued, he said vnto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among your selues, because ye haue brought no bread?
\v 9 \x + \xo 16:9 \xt Chap. 14.17.\x*Doe ye not yet vnderstand, neither remember the fiue loaues of the fiue thousand, and how many baskets ye tooke vp?
\v 10 \x + \xo 16:10 \xt Chap. 15.34.\x*Neither the seuen loaues of the foure thousand, and how many baskets ye tooke vp?
\v 11 How is it that ye doe not vnderstand, that I spake \add it\add* not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leauen of the Pharises, and of the Sadduces?
\v 12 Then vnderstood they how that he bade \add them\add* not beware of the leauen of bread: but of the doctrine of the Pharisees, and of the Sadduces.
\v 13 ¶ When Iesus came into the coasts of Cesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, \x + \xo 16:13 \xt Mar. 8.27. luke 9.18.\x*Whom doe men say, that I, the sonne of man, am?
\v 14 And they said, Some \add say that thou art\add* Iohn the Baptist, some Elias, and others Ieremias, or one of y\sup e\sup* Prophets.
\v 15 He saith vnto them, But whom say ye that I am?
\v 16 And Simon Peter answered, and said, \x + \xo 16:16 \xt Ioh. 6.69.\x*Thou art Christ the sonne of the liuing God.
\v 17 And Iesus answered, and said vnto him, Blessed art thou Simon Bar Iona: for flesh and blood hath not reueiled \add it\add* vnto thee, but my Father which is in heauen.
\v 18 And I say also vnto thee, that \x + \xo 16:18 \xt Ioh. 1.42.\x*thou art Peter, and vpon this rocke I will build my Church: and the gates of hell shall not preuaile against it.
\v 19 \x + \xo 16:19 \xt Ioh. 20.23.\x*And I will giue vnto thee the keyes of the kingdome of heauen: and whatsoeuer thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in heauen: whatsoeuer thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed in heauen.
\v 20 Then charged hee his disciples that they should tel no man that he was Iesus the Christ.
\v 21 ¶ From that time foorth began Iesus to shew vnto his disciples, how that he must goe vnto Hierusalem, and suffer many things of the Elders and chiefe Priests & Scribes, and be killed, and be raised againe the third day.
\v 22 Then Peter tooke him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it farre from thee Lord: This shal not be vnto thee.
\v 23 But he turned, and said vnto Peter, Get thee behind mee, Satan, thou art an offence vnto me: for thou sauourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.
\v 24 ¶ \x + \xo 16:24 \xt Chap. 10.38. mar. 8.34.\x*Then said Iesus vnto his disciples, If any \add man\add* will come after me, let him denie himselfe, and take vp his crosse, and follow me.
\v 25 For whosoeuer will saue his life, shall lose it: and whosoeuer will lose his his life for my sake, shall finde it.
\v 26 For what is a man profited, if hee shal gaine the whole world, and lose his owne soule? Or what shall a man giue in exchange for his soule?
\v 27 For the sonne of man shall come in the glory of his father, with his Angels: \x + \xo 16:27 \xt Psa. 62.12. rom. 2.6.\x*and then he shall reward euery man according to his works.

\v 1 ¶ And \x + \xo 17:1 \xt Mark. 9.2. luke 9.28.\x*after sixe dayes, Iesus taketh Peter, Iames, and Iohn his brother, and bringeth them vp into an high mountaine apart,
\v 2 And was transfigured before them, and his face did shine as the Sunne, and his raiment was white as the light.
\v 3 And behold, there appeared vnto them Moses, and Elias, talking with him.
\v 4 Then answered Peter, and saide vnto Iesus, Lord, it is good for vs to be here: If thou wilt, let vs make here three tabernacles: one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.
\v 5 \x + \xo 17:5 \xt 2.Pet. 1.17.\x*While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud ouershadowed them: and behold a voyce out of the cloude, which saide, This is my beloued sonne, in whom I am well pleased: heare ye him.
\v 6 And when the disciples heard \add it\add*, they fell on their face, and were sore afraid.
\v 7 And Iesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.
\v 8 And when they had lift vp their eyes, they saw no man, saue Iesus only.
\v 9 And as they came downe from the mountaine, Iesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, vntil the sonne of man bee risen againe from the dead.
\v 10 And his disciples asked him, saying, \x + \xo 17:10 \xt Chap. 11.14. mark. 9.12.\x*Why then say the Scribes that Elias must first come?
\v 11 And Iesus answered, and said vnto them, Elias truely shall first come, and restore all things:
\v 12 But I say vnto you, that Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but haue done vnto him whatsoeuer they listed: Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.
\v 13 Then the Disciples vnderstood that he spake vnto them of Iohn the Baptist.

\v 16 And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.
\v 17 Then Iesus answered, and said, O faithlesse and peruerse generation, how long shall I bee with you? howe long shal I suffer you? bring him hither to me.
\v 18 And Iesus rebuked the deuill, and hee departed out of him: and the childe was cured from that very houre.
\v 19 Then came the Disciples to Iesus apart, and said, Why could not we cast him out?
\v 20 And Iesus said vnto them, Because of your vnbeliefe: for verily I say vnto you, \x + \xo 17:20 \xt luke 17.6.\x*If yee haue faith as a graine of mustard seed, yee shall say vnto this mountaine; Remoue hence to yonder place: and it shall remoue, and nothing shall be vnpossible vnto you.

\v 26 Peter saith vnto him, Of strangers. Iesus saith vnto him, Then are the children free.
\v 27 Notwithstanding, least we should offend them, goe thou to the Sea, and cast an hooke, and take vp the fish that first commeth vp: and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find \f + \fr 17:27 \ft Or, a stater.

\v 30 And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till hee should pay the debt.
\v 31 So when his fellow-seruants saw what was done, they were very sorie, and came, and told vnto their lord all that was done.
\v 32 Then his lord, after that hee had called him, said vnto him, O thou wicked seruant, I forgaue thee all that debt because thou desiredst me:

\v 34 And his lord was wroth, and deliuered him to the tormentors, till hee should pay all that was due vnto him.
\v 35 So likewise shall my heauenly Father doe also vnto you, if yee from your hearts forgiue not euery one his brother their trespasses.

\iex 2 Christ healeth the sicke: 3 answereth the Pharisees concerning diuorcement: 10 sheweth when mariage is necessary: 13 receiueth litle children: 16 instructeth the yong man how to attaine eternall life, 20 and how to be perfect: 23 telleth his disciples how hard it is for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God, 27 and promiseth reward to those that forsake any thing, to follow him.
\v 1 ¶ And it came to passe, \x + \xo 19:1 \xt Mar. 10.1.\x*\add that\add* when Iesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coastes of Iudea, beyond Iordane:
\v 2 And great multitudes followed him, and he healed them there.
\v 3 ¶ The Pharisees also came vnto him, tempting him, and saying vnto him, Is it lawfull for a man to put away his wife for euery cause?
\v 4 And hee answered, and said vnto them, Haue ye not read, \x + \xo 19:4 \xt Gen. 1.27.\x*that he which made \add them\add* at the beginning, made them male and female?
\v 5 And said, \x + \xo 19:5 \xt Gen. 2.24. ephe. 5.31.\x*For this cause shall a man leaue father and mother, and shall cleaue to his wife: and \x + \xo 19:5 \xt 1.Cor. 6.16.\x*they twaine shalbe one flesh.
\v 6 Wherefore they are no more twaine, but one flesh. What therefore God hath ioyned together, let not man put asunder.
\v 7 They say vnto him, \x + \xo 19:7 \xt Deut. 24.1.\x*Why did Moses then command to giue a writing of diuorcement, and to put her away?
\v 8 Hee saith vnto them, Moses, because of the hardnesse of your hearts, suffered you to put away your wiues: but from the beginning it was not so.

\v 10 ¶ His disciples say vnto him, If the case of the man be so with \add his\add* wife, it is not good to marrie.
\v 11 But hee said vnto them, All \add men\add* cannot receiue this saying, saue \add they\add* to whom it is giuen.
\v 12 For there are some Eunuches, which were so borne from \add their\add* mothers wombe: and there are some Eunuches, which were made Eunuches of men: and there be Eunuches, which haue made themselues Eunuches for the kingdome of heauens sake.

\v 15 And he laide \add his\add* hands on them, and departed thence.
\v 16 ¶ \x + \xo 19:16 \xt Marke 10.17. luke 18.18.\x*And behold, one came and said vnto him, Good master, what good thing shall I do, that I may haue eternall life?
\v 17 And he said vnto him, Why callest thou me good? \add there is\add* none good but one, \add that is\add* God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandements.
\v 18 He saith vnto him, Which? Iesus said, \x + \xo 19:18 \xt Exod. 10.13.\x*Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steale, Thou shalt not beare false witnesse,
\v 19 Honour thy father and \add thy\add* mother: and, Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe.
\v 20 The young man saith vnto him, All these things haue I kept from my youth vp: what lacke I yet?
\v 21 Iesus said vnto him, If thou wilt be perfect, goe \add and\add* sell that thou hast, \add and\add* giue to the poore, and thou shalt haue treasure in heauen: and come and follow me.
\v 22 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowfull: for he had great possessions.

\v 24 And againe I say vnto you, It is easier for a camel to goe thorow the eye of a needle, then for a rich man to enter into the kingdome of God.

\iex 1 Christ by the similitude of the labourers in the vineyard, sheweth that God is debtor vnto no man: 17 Foretelleth his passion: 20 By answering the mother of Zebedeus children, teacheth his disciples to be lowly: 30 and giueth two blinde men their sight.
\v 1 ¶ For the kingdome of heauen is like vnto a man \add that is\add* an housholder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.
\v 2 And when hee had agreed with the labourers for a \f + \fr 20:2 \ft The Romane peny is the eight part of an ounce, which after fiue shillings the ounce, is seuen pence halfe peny.\f*peny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
\v 3 And he went out about the third houre, and saw others standing idle in the market place,
\v 4 And said vnto them, Go ye also into the vineyard, & whatsoeuer is right, I wil giue you. And they went their way.
\v 5 Againe he went out about the sixth and ninth houre, and did likewise.
\v 6 And about the eleuenth houre, he went out, and found others standing idle, and saith vnto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?
\v 7 They say vnto him, Because no man hath hired vs. He saith vnto them, Go ye also into the vineyard: and whatsoeuer is right, \add that\add* shall ye receiue.
\v 8 So when euen was come, the lord of the vineyard saith vnto his Steward, Call the labourers, and giue them \add their\add* hire, beginning from the last, vnto the first.
\v 9 And when they came that \add were hired\add* about the eleuenth houre, they receiued euery man a penie.
\v 10 But when the first came, they supposed that they should haue receiued more, and they likewise receiued euery man a penie.
\v 11 And when they had receiued \add it\add*, they murmured against the good man of the house,
\v 12 Saying, These last \f + \fr 20:12 \ft Or, haue continued one houre onely.\f*haue wrought \add but\add* one houre, and thou hast made them equall vnto vs, which haue borne the burden, and heat of the day.
\v 13 But he answered one of them and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penie?
\v 14 Take \add that\add* thine \add is\add*, and goe thy way, I will giue vnto this last, euen as vnto thee.
\v 15 Is it not lawfull for mee to doe what I wil with mine owne? Is thine eye euill, because I am good?

\v 17 ¶ \x + \xo 20:17 \xt Mar. 10.32. luke 18.31.\x*And Iesus going vp to Hierusalem, tooke the twelue disciples apart in the way, and said vnto them,

\v 21 And he said vnto her, What wilt thou? She saith vnto him, Grant, that these my two sonnes may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on the left in thy kingdome.
\v 22 But Iesus answered, and said, Ye know not what ye aske. Are ye able to drinke of the cup that I shall drinke of, and to be baptized with the baptisme that I am baptized with? They say vnto him, We are able.
\v 23 And he saith vnto them, Yee shall drinke indeed of my cup, and be baptized with the baptisme that I am baptized with: but to sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to giue, but \add it shall be giuen to them\add* for whom it is prepared of my father.
\v 24 And when the ten heard \add it\add*, they were moued with indignation against the two brethren.
\v 25 But Iesus called them \add vnto him\add*, and said, \x + \xo 20:25 \xt Luk. 22.25.\x*Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion ouer them, and they that are great, exercise authoritie vpon them.
\v 26 But it shall not be so among you: But whosoeuer will bee great among you, let him be your minister.
\v 27 And whosoeuer will be chiefe among you, let him be your seruant.
\v 28 Euen as the \x + \xo 20:28 \xt Phil. 2.7.\x*Sonne of man came not to be ministred vnto, but minister, and to giue his life a ransome for many.
\v 29 \x + \xo 20:29 \xt Mar.10.46. luke 18.35.\x*And as they departed from Hiericho, a great multitude followed him.

\v 31 And the multitude rebuked them, because they should holde their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Haue mercie on vs, O Lord, \add thou\add* sonne of Dauid.
\v 32 And Iesus stood still, and called them, and saide, What will yee that I shall doe vnto you?
\v 33 They say vnto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
\v 34 So Iesus had compassion \add on them\add*, and touched their eyes: and immediatly their eyes receiued sight, and they followed him.

\iex 1 Christ rideth into Hierusalem vpon an asse, 12 driueth the buyers and sellers out of the Temple, 17 curseth the fig-tree, 23 putteth to silence the Priests and Elders, 28 and rebuketh them by the similitude of the two sonnes, 35 and the husbandmen, who slew such as were sent vnto them.
\v 1 ¶ \x + \xo 21:1 \xt Marke 11.1. luke 19.29.\x*And when they drewe nigh vnto Hierusalem, and were come to Bethphage, vnto the mount of Oliues, then sent Iesus two Disciples,
\v 2 Saying vnto them, Goe into the village ouer against you, and straightway yee shall find an Asse tied, and a colt with her: loose \add them\add*, and bring \add them\add* vnto me.
\v 3 And if any \add man\add* say ought vnto you, yee shall say, The Lord hath need of them, and straightway hee will send them.
\v 4 All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet, saying,

\v 6 \x + \xo 21:6 \xt Marke 11.2.\x*And the Disciples went, and did as Iesus commanded them,
\v 7 And brought the Asse, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set \add him\add* thereon.
\v 8 And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way, others cut downe branches from the trees, and strawed \add them\add* in the way.
\v 9 And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the sonne of Dauid: Blessed \add is\add* he that commeth in the Name of the Lord, Hosanna in the highest.
\v 10 \x + \xo 21:10 \xt Marke 11.15. luke 19.45. iohn 2.13.\x*And when hee was come into Hierusalem, all the citie was mooued, saying, Who is this?
\v 11 And the multitude said, This is Iesus the Prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.
\v 12 ¶ And Iesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the Temple, and ouerthrew the tables of the money changers, and the seats of them that solde doues,
\v 13 And said vnto them, It is written, \x + \xo 21:13 \xt Esai. 56.7.\x*My house shall be called the house of prayer, \x + \xo 21:13 \xt Iere 7.11. mar. 11.17. luke. 19.46.\x*but yee haue made it a denne of theeues.
\v 14 And the blind and the lame came to him in the Temple, & he healed them.
\v 15 And when the chiefe Priests and Scribes saw the wonderfull things that he did, & the children crying in the temple, & saying, Hosanna to the sonne of Dauid, they were sore displeased,
\v 16 And said vnto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Iesus saith vnto them, Yea, haue yee neuer read, \x + \xo 21:16 \xt Psal. 8.2.\x*Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?
\v 17 ¶ And he left them, and went out of the citie into Bethany, and he lodged there.
\v 18 Now in the morning, as hee returned into the citie, he hungred.
\v 19 \x + \xo 21:19 \xt Marke 11.13.\x*And when he saw a figge tree in the way, hee came to it, and found nothing thereon but leaues only, and said vnto it, Let no fruite growe on thee hence forward for euer. And presently the figge tree withered away.
\v 20 And when the Disciples saw \add it\add*, they marueiled, saying, How soone is the figge tree withered away?
\v 21 Iesus answered, and said vnto them, Uerily I say vnto you, if yee haue faith, and doubt not, yee shall not onely doe this \add which is done\add* to the figge tree, but also, if ye shall say vnto this mountaine, Be thou remoued, and be thou cast into the Sea, it shall be done.
\v 22 And all things whatsoeuer yee shall aske in prayer, beleeuing, ye shall receiue.
\v 23 ¶ \x + \xo 21:23 \xt Marke 11.27. luke 20.1.\x*And when he was come into the temple, the chiefe Priests and the Elders of the people came vnto him as he was teaching, and said, By what authoritie doest thou these things? and who gaue thee this authoritie?
\v 24 And Iesus answered, and said vnto them, I also will aske you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authoritie I doe these things.
\v 25 The baptisme of Iohn, whence was it? from heauen, or of men? and they reasoned with themselues saying, If we shall say, From heauen, hee will say vnto vs, Why did ye not then beleeue him?
\v 26 But if we shall say, Of men, we feare the people, \x + \xo 21:26 \xt Chap. 14.5.\x*for all hold Iohn as a Prophet.
\v 27 And they answered Iesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said vnto them, Neither tell I you by what authoritie I doe these things.
\v 28 ¶ But what thinke you? A \add certaine\add* man had two sonnes, and he came to the first, and said, Sonne, goe worke to day in my vineyard.
\v 29 He answered, & said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.
\v 30 And hee came to the second, and said likewise: and hee answered, and said, I goe sir, and went not.
\v 31 Whether of them twaine did the will of \add his\add* father? They say vnto him, The first. Iesus saith vnto them, Uerely I say vnto you, that the Publicanes and the harlots go into the kingdome of God before you.
\v 32 For \x + \xo 21:32 \xt Chap. 3.1.\x*Iohn came vnto you in the way of righteousnesse, and ye beleeued him not: but the Publicanes and the harlots beleeued him. And ye when ye had seene \add it\add*, repented not afterward, that ye might beleeue him.
\v 33 ¶ Heare another parable. There was a certaine house-holder, \x + \xo 21:33 \xt Esa. 5.1. iere. 2.21. mark. 12.1. luke 20.9.\x*which planted a Uineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a wine-presse in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a farre countrey.
\v 34 And when the time of the fruite drew neere, he sent his seruants to the husbandmen, that they might receiue the fruits of it.
\v 35 And the husbandmen tooke his seruants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.
\v 36 Againe hee sent other seruants, moe then the first, and they did vnto them likewise.
\v 37 But last of all, he sent vnto them his sonne, saying, They will reuerence my sonne.
\v 38 But when the husbandmen saw the sonne, they said among themselues, \x + \xo 21:38 \xt Chap. 26.3. iohn. 11.53.\x*This is the heire, come, let vs kill him, and let vs sease on his inheritance.
\v 39 And they caught him, and cast \add him\add* out of the Uineyard, and slew \add him\add*.
\v 40 When the Lord therefore of the Uineyard commeth, what will he doe vnto those husbandmen?
\v 41 They say vnto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out \add his\add* Uineyard vnto other husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.
\v 42 Iesus saith vnto them, \x + \xo 21:42 \xt Psal. 118.22. acts. 4.11.\x*Did ye neuer reade in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders reiected, the same is become the head of the corner? This is the Lords doing, and it is marueilous in our eyes.
\v 43 Therefore say I vnto you, the kingdome of God shall be taken from you, and giuen to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.
\v 44 And \x + \xo 21:44 \xt Rom. 9.33. 1.Pet. 2.7. esa. 8.14.\x*whosoeuer shall fall on this stone, shalbe broken: but on whom soeuer it shall fall, it will grinde him to powder.
\v 45 And when the chiefe Priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceiued that he spake of them.
\v 46 But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they tooke him for a Prophet.

\iex 1 The parable of the marriage of the Kings sonne. 9 The vocation of the Gentiles. 12 The punishment of him that wanted the wedding garment. 15 Tribute ought to be payed to C&aelig;sar. 23 Christ confuteth the Sadducees for the Resurrection: 34 answereth the Lawyer, which is the first and great Commandement: 41 and poseth the Pharisees about the Messias.
\v 1 ¶ And Iesus answered, \x + \xo 22:1 \xt Luke 14.16. reuel. 19.9.\x*and spake vnto them againe by parables, and said,
\v 2 The Kingdome of heauen is like vnto a certaine King, which made a marriage for his sonne,
\v 3 And sent forth his seruants to call them that were bidden to the wedding, and they would not come.
\v 4 Againe, hee sent foorth other seruants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Beholde, I haue prepared my dinner; my oxen, and \add my\add* fatlings \add are\add* killed, and all things \add are\add* ready: come vnto the marriage.
\v 5 But they made light of \add it\add*, and went their wayes, one to his farme, another to his merchandize:
\v 6 And the remnant tooke his seruants, and intreated \add them\add* spitefully, and slew \add them\add*.
\v 7 But when the king heard \add thereof\add*, he was wroth, and hee sent foorth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burnt vp their citie.
\v 8 Then saith hee to his seruants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden, were not worthy.
\v 9 Goe yee therefore into the high wayes, and as many as yee shall finde, bid to the marriage.
\v 10 So those seruants went out into the high wayes, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good, and the wedding was furnished with ghests.
\v 11 ¶ And when the King came in to see the guests, hee sawe there a man, which had not on a wedding garment,
\v 12 And hee sayth vnto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither, not hauing a wedding garment? And hee was speechlesse.
\v 13 Then said the king to the seruants, Binde him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast \add him\add* into outer darkenesse, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
\v 14 \x + \xo 22:14 \xt Chap. 20.16.\x*For many are called, but few \add are\add* chosen.

\v 16 And they sent out vnto him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying, Master, wee know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in trueth, neither carest thou for any \add man\add*; for thou regardest not the person of men.
\v 17 Tell vs therefore, what thinkest thou? Is it lawfull to giue tribute vnto Cesar, or not?
\v 18 But Iesus perceiued their wickednesse, and said, Why tempt ye me, \add ye\add* hypocrites?
\v 19 Shew me the tribute money. And they brought vnto him a \f + \fr 22:19 \ft In value seven pence halfe peny, \xt chap. 20.2.\f*peny.
\v 20 And he sayth vnto them, Whose \add is\add* this image and \f + \fr 22:20 \ft Or, inscription.\f*superscription?
\v 21 They say vnto him, Cesars. Then sayth he vnto them, \x + \xo 22:21 \xt Rom. 13.7.\x*Render therefore vnto Cesar, the things which are Cesars: and vnto God, the things that are Gods.
\v 22 When they had heard these wordes, they marueiled, and left him, and went their way.
\v 23 ¶ \x + \xo 22:23 \xt Marke 12.18. luke 20.27.\x*The same day came to him the Sadduces, \x + \xo 22:23 \xt Acts 23.8.\x*which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,
\v 24 Saying, Master, \x + \xo 22:24 \xt Deu. 25.5.\x*Moses said, If a man die, hauing no children, his brother shall marrie his wife, and raise vp seed vnto his brother.
\v 25 Now there were with vs seuen brethren, and the first when he had maried a wife, deceased, and hauing no issue, left his wife vnto his brother.
\v 26 Likewise the second also, and the third, vnto the seuenth.
\v 27 And last of al the woman died also.
\v 28 Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife shall she be of the seuen? for they all had her.
\v 29 Iesus answered, and said vnto them, Yee doe erre, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.
\v 30 For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are giuen in marriage, but are as the Angels of God in heauen.
\v 31 But as touching the resurrection of the dead, haue ye not read that which was spoken vnto you by God, saying,
\v 32 \x + \xo 22:32 \xt Exod. 3.6.\x*I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Iacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the liuing.
\v 33 And when the multitude heard \add this\add*, they were astonished at his doctrine.
\v 34 ¶ \x + \xo 22:34 \xt Marke 12.28.\x*But when the Pharises had heard that he had put the Sadduces to silence, they were gathered together.
\v 35 Then one of them, \add which was\add* a Lawyer, asked \add him a question\add*, tempting him, and saying,
\v 36 Master, which \add is\add* the great Commandement in the Law?
\v 37 Iesus sayd vnto him, \x + \xo 22:37 \xt Deut. 6.5. luke 10.27.\x*Thou shalt loue the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soule, and with all thy minde.
\v 38 This is the first and great Commandement.
\v 39 And the second \add is\add* like vnto it, \x + \xo 22:39 \xt Leuit. 19.18.\x*Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe.
\v 40 On these two Commandements hang all the Law and the Prophets.
\v 41 ¶ \x + \xo 22:41 \xt Marke 12.35. luke 20.41.\x*While the Pharises were gathered together, Iesus asked them,
\v 42 Saying, What thinke yee of Christ? whose sonne is hee? They say vnto him, The sonne of Dauid.
\v 43 He saith vnto them, How then doth Dauid in spirit call him Lord, saying,
\v 44 The Lord said vnto my Lord, \x + \xo 22:44 \xt Psal. 110.1.\x*Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstoole?
\v 45 If Dauid then call him Lord, how is he his sonne?

\iex 1 Christ admonisheth the people to follow the good doctrine, not the euill examples of the Scribes and Pharises. 5 His disciples must beware of their ambition. 13 Hee denounceth eight woes against their hypocrisie and blindnesse: 34 and prophecieth of the destruction of Hierusalem.

\v 16 Woe vnto you, yee blind guides, which say, Whosoeuer shall sweare by the Temple, it is nothing: but whosoeuer shal sweare by the gold of the Temple, he is a debter.
\v 17 \add Ye\add* fooles and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the Temple that sanctifieth the gold?

\iex 1 Christ foretelleth the destruction of the temple: 3 what, and how great calamities shall be before it: 29 the signes of his comming to iudgement. 36 And because that day and houre is vnknowen, 42 we ought to watch like good seruants expecting euery moment our masters comming.
\v 1 ¶ And \x + \xo 24:1 \xt Mar. 13.1. luke 21.5.\x*Iesus went out, and departed from the temple, and his Disciples came to \add him\add*, for to shew him the buildings of the temple.

\v 4 And Iesus answered, and said vnto them, Take heed that no man deceiue you.

\v 6 And yee shall heare of warres, and rumors of warres: See that yee be not troubled: for all \add these things\add* must come to passe, but the end is not yet.
\v 7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdome against kingdome, and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes in diuers places.
\v 8 All these \add are\add* the beginning of sorrowes.
\v 9 \x + \xo 24:9 \xt Chap. 10.17. luke 21.12. iohn 16.2.\x*Then shall they deliuer you vp to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and yee shall bee hated of all nations for my names sake.

\v 13 But he that shall endure vnto the end, the same shall be saued.
\v 14 And this Gospell of the kingdome shall be preached in all the world, for a witnesse vnto al nations, and then shall the end come.

\v 19 And woe vnto them that are with child, and to them that giue sucke in those dayes.
\v 20 But pray yee that your flight bee not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath day:

\v 2 And fiue of them were wise, and fiue \add were\add* foolish.
\v 3 They that \add were\add* foolish tooke their lampes, and tooke no oyle with them:
\v 4 But the wise tooke oyle in their vessels with their lampes.
\v 5 While the bridegrome taried, they all slumbred and slept.
\v 6 And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegrome commeth, goe ye out to meet him.
\v 7 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lampes.
\v 8 And the foolish said vnto the wise, Giue vs of your oyle, for our lampes are \f + \fr 25:8 \ft Or, going out,\f*gone out.

\v 10 And while they went to buy, the bridegrome came, and they that were ready, went in with him to the marriage, and the doore was shut.
\v 11 Afterward came also the other virgines, saying, Lord, Lord, open to vs.
\v 12 But he answered, and said, Uerely I say vnto you, I know you not.

\v 17 And likewise he that \add had receiued\add* two, he also gained other two.
\v 18 But hee that had receiued one, went and digged in the earth, and hid his lordes money.
\v 19 After a long time, the lord of those seruants commeth, and reckoneth with them.
\v 20 And so hee that had receiued fiue talents, came and brought other fiue talents, saying, Lord, thou deliueredst vnto me fiue talents, behold, I haue gained besides them, fiue talents moe.
\v 21 His lord said vnto him, Well done, \add thou\add* good and faithfull seruant, thou hast been faithfull ouer a few things, I wil make thee ruler ouer many things: enter thou into the ioy of thy lord.
\v 22 He also that had receiued two talents, came and said, Lord, thou deliueredst vnto me two talents: behold, I haue gained two other talents besides them.
\v 23 His lord said vnto him, Well done, good and faithfull seruant, thou hast beene faithfull ouer a few things, I wil make thee ruler ouer many things: enter thou into the ioy of thy lord.
\v 24 Then he which had receiued the one talent, came & said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sowen, & gathering where thou hast not strawed:
\v 25 And I was afraid, and went and hidde thy talent in the earth: loe, \add there\add* thou hast \add that is\add* thine.
\v 26 His lord answered, and said vnto him, \add Thou\add* wicked and slouthfull seruant, thou knewest that I reape where I sowed not, and gather where I haue not strawed:
\v 27 Thou oughtest therefore to haue put my money to the exchangers, and \add then\add* at my comming I should haue receiued mine owne with vsurie.

\v 9 For this ointment might haue bin sold for much, and giuen to the poore.

\v 11 \x + \xo 26:11 \xt Deu. 15.11.\x*For ye haue the poore alwayes with you, but me ye haue not alwayes.

\v 36 ¶ \x + \xo 26:36 \xt Marke 14.32. luke 22.39.\x*Then commeth Iesus with them vnto a place called Gethsemane, and saith vnto the Disciples, Sit yee heere, while I goe and pray yonder.
\v 37 And hee tooke with him Peter, and the two sonnes of Zebedee, and beganne to be sorrowful, and very heauie.
\v 38 Then saith he vnto them, My soule is exceeding sorrowfull, euen vnto death: tary ye heere, & watch with me.
\v 39 And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my father, if it be possible, let this cup passe from me: neuerthelesse, not as I will, but as thou \add wilt\add*.
\v 40 And he commeth vnto the Disciples, and findeth them asleepe, and saith vnto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one houre?
\v 41 Watch and pray, that yee enter not into temptation: The spirit indeed \add is\add* willing, but the flesh \add is\add* weake.
\v 42 He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my father, if this cup may not passe away from me, except I drinke it, thy will be done.
\v 43 And he came and found them asleep againe: For their eies were heauie.
\v 44 And he left them, and went away againe, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.
\v 45 Then commeth he to his Disciples, and saith vnto them, Sleepe on now, and take \add your\add* rest, behold, the houre is at hand, and the sonne of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
\v 46 Rise, let vs be going: behold, he is at hand that doeth betray me.
\v 47 ¶ And \x + \xo 26:47 \xt Mar. 14.43. luke 22.47. iohn 18.3.\x*while yet spake, loe, Iudas one of the twelue came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staues from the chiefe Priests and Elders of the people.
\v 48 Now he that betrayed him, gaue them a signe, saying, Whomsoeuer I shall kisse, that same is he, hold him fast.
\v 49 And forthwith hee came to Iesus, and said, Haile master, and kissed him.
\v 50 And Iesus said vnto him, Friend, Wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid handes on Iesus, and tooke him.
\v 51 And behold, one of them which were with Iesus, stretched out \add his\add* hand, and drew his sword, and stroke a seruant of the high Priests, and smote off his eare.
\v 52 Then said Iesus vnto him, Put vp againe thy sword into his place: \x + \xo 26:52 \xt Gen. 9.6. reuel. 13.10.\x*for all they that take the sword, shall perish with the sword.
\v 53 Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my father, and he shall presently giue me more then twelue legions of Angels?
\v 54 But how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, \x + \xo 26:54 \xt Esai. 53.10.\x*that thus it must be?
\v 55 In that same houre said Iesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thiefe with swords and staues for to take mee? I sate daily with you teaching in the Temple, and ye laide no hold on me.
\v 56 But all this was done, that the \x + \xo 26:56 \xt Lamen. 4.20.\x*Scriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the Disciples forsooke him, and fled:
\v 57 ¶ \x + \xo 26:57 \xt Mark. 14.53. luke 22.54. iohn 18.13.\x*And they that had laid hold on Iesus, led \add him\add* away to Caiaphas the high Priest, where the Scribes and the Elders were assembled.
\v 58 But Peter followed him afarre off, vnto the high Priests palace, and went in, and sate with the seruants to see the end.
\v 59 Now the chiefe Priests and Elders, and all the councell, sought false witnesse against Iesus to put him to death,
\v 60 But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, \add yet\add* found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,
\v 61 And said, This \add fellow\add* said, \x + \xo 26:61 \xt Iohn 2.19.\x*I am able to destroy the Temple of God, and to build it in three dayes.
\v 62 And the high Priest arose, and said vnto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it, which these witnesse against thee?
\v 63 But Iesus held his peace. And the high Priest answered, and said vnto him, I adiure thee by the liuing God, that thou tell vs, whether thou bee the Christ the Sonne of God.
\v 64 Iesus saith vnto him, Thou hast saide: Neuerthelesse I say vnto you, \x + \xo 26:64 \xt Chap. 16.27. 1. thess. 4.16. rom. 14.10.\x*Hereafter shall yee see the Sonne of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heauen.
\v 65 Then the high Priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemie: what further need haue wee of witnesses? Behold, now ye haue heard his blasphemie.
\v 66 What thinke ye? They answered and said, He is guiltie of death.
\v 67 \x + \xo 26:67 \xt Esay. 50.6.\x*Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him, and others smote \add him\add* with \f + \fr 26:67 \ft Or, rods.\f*the palmes of their hands,
\v 68 Saying, Prophecie vnto vs, thou Christ, who is he that smote thee?
\v 69 ¶ \x + \xo 26:69 \xt Mark. 14.66. luke 22.55. iohn 18.25.\x*Now Peter sate without in the palace: and a damosell came vnto him, saying, Thou also wast with Iesus of Galilee.
\v 70 But hee denied before \add them\add* all, saying, I know not what thou saiest.
\v 71 And when he was gone out into the porch, another maide saw him, and saide vnto them that were there, This \add fellow\add* was also with Iesus of Nazareth.
\v 72 And againe hee denied with an oath, I doe not know the man.
\v 73 And after a while came vnto \add him\add* they that stood by, and saide to Peter, Surely thou also art \add one\add* of them, for thy speech bewrayeth thee.
\v 74 Then beganne hee to curse and to sweare, \add saying\add*, I know not the man. And immediatly the cocke crew.
\v 75 And Peter remembred the words of Iesus, which said vnto him, Before the cocke crow, thou shalt denie mee thrice. And hee went out, and wept bitterly.

\iex 1 Christ is deliuered bound to Pilate. 3 Iudas hangeth himselfe. 19 Pilate admonished of his wise, 24 washeth his hands: 26 and looseth Barabbas. 29 Christ is crowned with thornes, 34 crucified, 40 reuiled, 50 dieth, and is buried: 66 his Sepulchre is sealed, and watched.
\v 1 ¶ When the morning was come, \x + \xo 27:1 \xt Mark. 15.1. luke 22.66. ioh. 18.28.\x*all the chiefe Priests and Elders of the people, tooke counsell against Iesus to put him to death.
\v 2 And when they had bound him, they led \add him\add* away, and deliuered him to Pontius Pilate the gouernour.
\v 3 ¶ Then Iudas, which had betraied him, when he saw that hee was condemned, repented himselfe, and brought againe the thirtie pieces of siluer to the chiefe Priests and Elders,
\v 4 Saying, I haue sinned, in that I haue betraied the innocent blood. And they said, What \add is that\add* to vs? see thou \add to that\add*.
\v 5 And hee cast downe the pieces of siluer in the Temple, \x + \xo 27:5 \xt Act. 1.18.\x*and departed, and went and hanged himselfe.
\v 6 And the chiefe Priests tooke the siluer pieces, and said, It is not lawfull for to put them into the treasurie, because it is the price of blood.
\v 7 And they tooke counsell, and bought with them the potters field, to burie strangers in.
\v 8 Wherefore that field was called, \x + \xo 27:8 \xt Acts. 1.19.\x*The field of blood vnto this day.
\v 9 (Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Ieremie the Prophet, saying, \x + \xo 27:9 \xt Zach. 11.12.\x*And they tooke the thirtie pieces of siluer, the price of him that was valued, \f + \fr 27:9 \ft Or, whom they bought of the children of Israel.\f*whom they of the children of Israel did value:
\v 10 And gaue them for the potters field, as the Lord appointed me.)
\v 11 And Iesus stood before the gouernour, and the gouernour asked him, saying; Art thou the King of the Iewes? And Iesus sayd vnto him, Thou sayest.
\v 12 And when hee was accused of the chiefe Priests and Elders, he answered nothing.
\v 13 Then saith Pilate vnto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witnesse against thee?
\v 14 And he answered him to neuer a word: insomuch that the Gouernour marueiled greatly.
\v 15 \x + \xo 27:15 \xt Luke 23.17.\x*Now at \add that\add* feast the Gouernor was woont to release vnto the people a prisoner, whom they would.
\v 16 And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.
\v 17 Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said vnto them, Whom will ye that I release vnto you? Barabbas, or Iesus, which is called Christ?
\v 18 For hee knew that for enuie they had deliuered him.
\v 19 ¶ When he was set downe on the Iudgement seate, his wife sent vnto him, saying, Haue thou nothing to doe with that iust man: for I haue suffered many things this day in a dreame, because of him.
\v 20 \x + \xo 27:20 \xt Iohn 18.40. actes 3.14\x*But the chiefe Priestes and Elders perswaded the multitude that they should aske Barabbas, & destroy Iesus.
\v 21 The Gouernour answered, and said vnto them, Whether of the twaine will ye that I release vnto you? They said, Barabbas.
\v 22 Pilate said vnto them, What shall I doe then with Iesus, which is called Christ? \add They\add* all sayde vnto him, Let him be crucified.
\v 23 And the Gouernour said, Why, what euil hath he done? But they cried out y\sup e\sup* more, saying, Let him be crucified.
\v 24 ¶ When Pilate saw that he could preuaile nothing, but \add that\add* rather a tumult was made, hee tooke water, and washed \add his\add* hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this iust person: see yee \add to it\add*.
\v 25 Then answered all the people, and said, His blood \add be\add* on vs, and on our children.
\v 26 ¶ Then released hee Barabbas vnto them, and when he had scourged Iesus, he deliuered \add him\add* to be crucified.
\v 27 \x + \xo 27:27 \xt Ioh. 19.1.\x*\f + \fr 27:27 \ft Or, gouernours house.\f*Then the souldiers of the Gouernour tooke Iesus into the common hall, and gathered vnto him the whole band of souldiers.
\v 28 And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.
\v 29 ¶ And when they had platted a crowne of thornes, they put \add it\add* vpon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Haile king of the Iewes.
\v 30 And they spit vpon him, and tooke the reed, and smote him on the head.
\v 31 And after that they had mocked him, they tooke the robe off from him, and put his owne raiment on him, and led him away to crucifie \add him\add*.
\v 32 \x + \xo 27:32 \xt Marke 15.21. luke 23.26.\x*And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to beare his Crosse.
\v 33 \x + \xo 27:33 \xt Iohn 19.17.\x*And when they were come vnto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, a place of a skull,
\v 34 ¶ They gaue him vineger to drinke, mingled with gall: and when hee had tasted \add thereof\add*, hee would not drinke.
\v 35 And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet, \x + \xo 27:35 \xt Psal. 22.18.\x*They parted my garments among them, and vpon my vesture did they cast lots.
\v 36 And sitting downe, they watched him there:
\v 37 And set vp ouer his head, his accusation written, THIS IS IESVS THE KING OF THE IEWES.
\v 38 Then were there two theeues crucified with him: one on the right hand, and another on the left.
\v 39 ¶ And they that passed by, reuiled him, wagging their heads,
\v 40 And saying, Thou that destroyest the Temple, & buildest \add it\add* in three dayes, saue thy selfe: If thou be the Sonne of God, come downe from the Crosse.
\v 41 Likewise also the chiefe Priests mocking \add him\add*, with the Scribes and Elders, said,
\v 42 He saued others, himselfe he cannot saue: If he be the King of Israel, let him now come downe from the Crosse, and we will beleeue him.
\v 43 \x + \xo 27:43 \xt Psal. 22.8. wisd. 2.15,16.\x*He trusted in God, let him deliuer him now if hee will haue him: for he said, I am the Sonne of God.
\v 44 The thieues also which were crucified with him, cast y\sup e\sup* same in his teeth.
\v 45 Now from the sixth houre there was darkenesse ouer all the land vnto the ninth houre.
\v 46 And about the ninth houre, Iesus cried with a loud voyce, saying, Eli, Eli, Lamasabachthani, that is to say, \x + \xo 27:46 \xt Psal. 22.1.\x*My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken mee?
\v 47 Some of them that stood there, when they heard \add that\add*, said, This \add man\add* calleth for Elias.
\v 48 And straightway one of them ran, and tooke a spunge, \x + \xo 27:48 \xt Psa. 69.22.\x*and filled \add it\add* with vineger, and put \add it\add* on a reede, and gaue him to drinke.
\v 49 The rest said, Let bee, let vs see whether Elias will come to saue him.
\v 50 ¶ Iesus, when hee had cried againe with a loud voice, yeelded vp the ghost.
\v 51 And behold, the vaile of the Temple was rent in twaine, from the top to the bottome, and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent.
\v 52 And the graues were opened, and many bodies of Saints which slept, arose,
\v 53 And came out of the graues after his resurrection, and went into the holy citie, and appeared vnto many.
\v 54 Now when the Centurion, and they that were with him, watching Iesus, saw the earthquake, & those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truely this was the Son of God.
\v 55 And many women were there (beholding afarre off) which followed Iesus from Galilee, ministring vnto him.
\v 56 Among which was Mary Magdalene, & Mary the mother of Iames and Ioses, and the mother of Zebedees children.
\v 57 \x + \xo 27:57 \xt Mar. 15.42. luk.23.50. ioh. 19.38.\x*When the Euen was come, there came a rich man of Arimathea, named Ioseph, who also himselfe was Iesus disciple:
\v 58 He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Iesus: then Pilate commanded the body to be deliuered.
\v 59 And when Ioseph had taken the body, hee wrapped it in a cleane linnen cloth,
\v 60 And laide it in his owne newe tombe, which he had hewen out in the rocke: and he rolled a great stone to the doore of the sepulchre, and departed.
\v 61 And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting ouer against the sepulchre.
\v 62 ¶ Now the next day that followed the day of the preparation, the chiefe Priests and Pharisees came together vnto Pilate,
\v 63 Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiuer said, while he was yet aliue, After three daies I wil rise againe.
\v 64 Command therfore that the sepulchre be made sure, vntill the third day, lest his disciples come by night, & steale him away, and say vnto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last errour shalbe worse then the first.
\v 65 Pilate said vnto them, Yee haue a watch, goe your way, make \add it\add* as sure as you can.
\v 66 So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.

\iex 1 Christs resurrection is declared by an Angel, to the women. 9 He himselfe appeareth vnto them. 11 The high Priests giue the souldiers money to say that he was stollen out of his sepulchre. 16 Christ appeareth to his disciples, 19 and sendeth them to baptize and teach all Nations.
\v 1 ¶ In the \x + \xo 28:1 \xt Mar. 16.1. iohn 20.1.\x*ende of the Sabbath, as it began to dawne towards the first \add day\add* of the weeke, came Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, to see the sepulchre.
\v 2 And behold, there \f + \fr 28:2 \ft Or, had bin\f*was a great earthquake, for the Angel of the Lord descended from heauen, and came and rolled backe the stone from the doore, and sate vpon it.
\v 3 His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snowe.
\v 4 And for feare of him, the keepers did shake, and became as dead \add men\add*.
\v 5 And the Angel answered, and said vnto the women, Feare not ye: for I know that ye seeke Iesus, which was crucified.
\v 6 He is not here: for he is risen, as hee said: Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
\v 7 And goe quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead. And behold, hee goeth before you into Galilee, there shall ye see him: loe, I haue told you.
\v 8 And they departed quickly from the sepulchre, with feare and great ioy, and did run to bring his disciples word.
\v 9 ¶ And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Iesus met them, saying, All haile. And they came, and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.
\v 10 Then said Iesus vnto them, Be not afraid: Goe tell my brethren that they goe into Galilee, and there shall they see me.
\v 11 ¶ Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the citie, and shewed vnto the chiefe Priests all the things that were done.
\v 12 And when they were assembled with the Elders, and had taken counsell, they gaue large money vnto the souldiers,
\v 13 Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him \add away\add* while we slept.
\v 14 And if this come to the gouernours eares, wee will perswade him, and secure you.
\v 15 So they tooke the money, and did as they were taught. And this saying is commonly reported among the Iewes vntill this day.
\v 16 ¶ Then the eleuen disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountaine where Iesus had appointed them.
\v 17 And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.
\v 18 And Iesus came, and spake vnto them, saying, All power is giuen vnto me in heauen and in earth.
\v 19 ¶ \x + \xo 28:19 \xt Mala. 3.1.\x*Goe ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghost:
\v 20 Teaching them to obserue all things, whatsoeuer I haue commanded you: and loe, I am with you alway, \add euen\add* vnto the end of the world. Amen.
