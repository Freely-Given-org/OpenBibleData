\iex 1 The vncleane are remoued out of the campe. 5 Restitution is to be made in trespasses. 11 The triall of Iealousie.
\v 1 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto Moses, saying,

\v 4 And the children of Israel did so, and put them out, without the campe: as the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto Moses, so did the children of Israel.
\v 5 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto Moses, saying,
\v 6 Speake vnto the children of Israel, \x + \xo 5:6 \xt Leuit. 6.3.\x*When a man or woman shall commit any sinne that men commit, to doe a trespasse against the \nd LORD\nd*, and that person be guiltie;

\v 11 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto Moses, saying,

\v 13 And a man lye with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and \add there be\add* no witnesse against her, neither she be taken with the maner;
\v 14 And the spirit of ielousie come vpon him, and he be ielous of his wife, and shee be defiled: or if the spirit of ielousie come vpon him, and hee be ielous of his wife, and she be not defiled:
\v 15 Then shall the man bring his wife vnto the Priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth \add part\add* of an Ephah of barley meale: hee shall powre no oyle vpon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it \add is\add* an offering of ielousie, an offering of memoriall, bringing iniquitie to remembrance:
\v 16 And the Priest shall bring her neere, and set her before the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 17 And the Priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessell, and of the dust that is in the floore of the Tabernacle the Priest shall take, and put \add it\add* into the water:
\v 18 And the Priest shall set the woman before the \nd LORD\nd*, and vncouer the womans head, and put the offering of memoriall in her hands, which \add is\add* the Ielousie offering: and the Priest shall haue in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse.
\v 19 And the Priest shall charge her by an othe, and say vnto the woman, If no man haue lyen with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to vncleannesse \f + \fr 5:19 \ft Or, being in the power of thy husband.

\v 20 But if thou hast gone aside \add to another\add* in stead of thy husband, and if thou be defiled, and some man hath lien with thee beside thine husband:
\v 21 Then the Priest shall charge the woman with an othe of cursing, and the Priest shall say vnto the woman, The \nd LORD\nd* make thee a curse, and an othe among thy people, when the \nd LORD\nd* doth make thy thigh to \f + \fr 5:21 \ft Hebr. fall.\f*rot, and thy belly to swell.
\v 22 And this water that causeth the curse, shall go into thy bowels, to make \add thy\add* belly to swell, and \add thy\add* thigh to rot: and the woman shall say, Amen, Amen.
\v 23 And the Priest shall write these curses in a booke, and hee shall blot \add them\add* out with the bitter water:

\v 27 And when he hath made her to drinke the water, then it shall come to passe, \add that\add* if shee be defiled, and haue done trespasse against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse, shall enter into her, \add and become\add* bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shal rot: and the woman shalbe a curse among her people.
\v 28 And if the woman be not defiled, but be cleane, then she shall be free, and shall conceiue seed.
\v 29 This \add is\add* the law of ielousies, when a wife goeth aside \add to another\add* in stead of her husband, and is defiled:
\v 30 Or when the spirit of ielousie commeth vpon him, and hee be ielous ouer his wife, and shall set the woman before the \nd LORD\nd*, and the Priest shal execute vpon her all this law.
\v 31 Then shall the man bee guiltlesse from iniquitie, and this woman shall beare her iniquitie.

\v 1 ¶ And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses, because of the \f + \fr 12:1 \ft Or, Cushite.\f*Ethiophian woman, whom hee had \f + \fr 12:1 \ft Hebr. taken.\f*married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.
\v 2 And they said, Hath the \nd LORD\nd* indeed spoken onely by Moses? Hath hee not spoken also by vs? And the \nd LORD\nd* heard \add it\add*.
\v 3 (Now the man Moses \add was\add* \x + \xo 12:3 \xt Ecclu. 45.4.\x*very meeke, aboue all the men which \add were\add* vpon the face of the earth.)
\v 4 And the \nd LORD\nd* spake suddenly vnto Moses, and vnto Aaron, and vnto Miriam, Come out ye three vnto the Tabernacle of the Congregation: and they three came out.
\v 5 And the \nd LORD\nd* came downe in the pillar of the cloude, and stood \add in\add* the doore of the Tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came foorth.
\v 6 And hee saide, Heare now my words: If there be a Prophet among you, \add I\add* the \nd LORD\nd* will make my selfe knowen vnto him in a vision, \add and\add* will speake vnto him in a dreame:
\v 7 \x + \xo 12:7 \xt Hebr. 3.2.\x*My seruant Moses \add is\add* not so, who \add is\add* faithfull in all mine house.
\v 8 With him will I speake \x + \xo 12:8 \xt Exod. 33.11.\x*mouth to mouth euen apparantly, and not in darke speeches, and the similitude of the \nd LORD\nd* shall hee behold: wherefore then were yee not afraid to speake against my seruant Moses?
\v 9 And the anger of the \nd LORD\nd* was kindled against them, and he departed.
\v 10 And the cloud departed from off the Tabernacle, and behold, Miriam \add became\add* leprous, \add white\add* as snow: and Aaron looked vpon Miriam, and behold, \add she was\add* leprous.
\v 11 And Aaron said vnto Moses, Alas my lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sinne vpon vs, wherein we haue done foolishly, and wherein we haue sinned:
\v 12 Let her not bee as one dead, of whom the flesh is halfe consumed, when he commeth out of his mothers wombe.
\v 13 And Moses cryed vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, saying, Heale her now, O God, I beseech thee.
\v 14 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not bee ashamed seuen dayes? let her be \x + \xo 12:14 \xt Leuit. 13.46.\x*shut out from the campe seuen dayes, and after that let her be receiued in againe.
\v 15 And Miriam was shut out from the campe seuen dayes: and the people iourneied not, til Miriam was brought in againe.
\v 16 And afterward the people remoued from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wildernesse of Paran.

\iex 1 The names of the men who were sent to search the land. 17 Their instructions. 21 Their actes. 26 Their relation.
\v 1 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto Moses, saying,
\v 2 Send thou men, that they may search the lande of Canaan, which I giue vnto the children of Israel: of euery tribe of their fathers shal ye send a man, euery one a ruler among them.
\v 3 And Moses by the commaundement of the \nd LORD\nd*, sent them from the wildernes of Paran: all those men \add were\add* heads of the children of Israel.
\v 4 And these \add were\add* their names. Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the sonne of Zaccur.
\v 5 Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the sonne of Hori.
\v 6 Of the tribe of Iudah, Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh.
\v 7 Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the sonne of Ioseph.
\v 8 Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the sonne of Nun.
\v 9 Of the tribe of Beniamin, Palti the sonne of Raphu.
\v 10 Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the sonne of Sodi.
\v 11 Of the tribe of Ioseph, \add namely\add* of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the sonne of Susi.
\v 12 Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the sonne of Gemalli.
\v 13 Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the sonne of Michael.
\v 14 Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the sonne of Uophsi.
\v 15 Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the sonne of Machi.
\v 16 These \add are\add* the names of the men which Moses sent to spie out the land: and Moses called Oshea the sonne of Nun, Iehoshua.
\v 17 ¶ And Moses sent them to spie out the land of Canaan, and said vnto them, Get you by this \add way\add* Southward, and goe vp into the mountaine:
\v 18 And see the lande what it \add is\add*, and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they \add bee\add* strong or weake, fewe or many:
\v 19 And what the lande \add is\add* that they dwell in, whether it \add be\add* good or bad, and what cities they bee that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds:
\v 20 And what the land \add is\add*, whether it \add be\add* fat or leane, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land: (Now the time \add was\add* the time of the first ripe grapes)
\v 21 ¶ So they went vp, and searched the land, from the wildernesse of Zin, vnto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.
\v 22 And they ascended by the South, and came vnto Hebron: where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak \add were\add*: Now Hebron was built seuen yeeres before Zoan in Egypt.
\v 23 \x + \xo 13:23 \xt Deut. 1.24.\x*And they came vnto the \f + \fr 13:23 \ft Or, valley\f*brooke of Eshcol, and cut downe from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it betweene two vpon a staffe, and \add they brought\add* of the pomegranates and of the figs.
\v 24 The place was called the \f + \fr 13:24 \ft Or, valley.\f*brooke \f + \fr 13:24 \ft i. a cluster of grapes.\f*Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut downe from thence.
\v 25 And they returned from searching of the land after fourty dayes.
\v 26 ¶ And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the Congregation of the children of Israel vnto the wildernesse of Paran, to Kadesh, and brought backe word vnto them, and vnto all the Congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land.
\v 27 And they told him, and said, We came vnto the land whither thou sentest vs, & surely it floweth with \x + \xo 13:27 \xt Exod. 33.3.\x*milke and honie; and this \add is\add* the fruit of it.
\v 28 Neuerthelesse, the people \add bee\add* strong that dwell in the land, and the cities \add are\add* walled \add and\add* very great: and moreouer, we saw the children of Anak there.
\v 29 The Amalekites dwell in the land of the South: and the Hittites, and the Iebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the mountaines: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Iordane.
\v 30 And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let vs goe vp at once, and possesse it, for we are well able to ouercome it.
\v 31 But the men that went vp with him, said, Wee be not able to goe vp against the people, for they \add are\add* stronger then we.
\v 32 And they brought vp an euill report of the land which they had searched, vnto the children of Israel, saying, The land through which we haue gone, to search it, \add is\add* a land that eateth vp the inhabitants thereof, and all the people that we saw in it, \add are\add* \f + \fr 13:32 \ft Heb. men of statures.\f*men of a great stature.
\v 33 And there we saw the giants, the sonnes of Anak, \add which come\add* of the giants: and wee were in our owne sight as grashoppers, and so wee were in their sight.
\c 14
\iex 1 The people murmure at the newes. 6 Ioshua and Caleb labour to stil them. 11 God threatneth them. 13 Moses perswadeth God and obtaineth pardon. 26 The murmurers are depriued of entring into the land. 36 The men who raised the euill report, die by a plague. 40 The people that would inuade the land against the wil of God, are smitten.
\v 1 ¶ And all the Congregation lifted vp their voyce and cried; and the people wept that night.
\v 2 And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses, and against Aaron: and the whole Congregation said vnto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt, or would God we had died in this wildernesse.
\v 3 And wherefore hath the \nd LORD\nd* brought vs vnto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wiues, and our children should be a pray? Were it not better for vs to returne into Egypt?
\v 4 And they saide one to another, Let vs make a captaine, and let vs returne into Egypt.
\v 5 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the Congregation of the children of Israel.
\v 6 ¶ And Ioshua the sonne of Nun, and Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh, \add which were\add* of them that searched the land, rent their clothes.
\v 7 And they spake vnto all the company of the children of Israel, saying. The land which wee passed thorow to search it, \add is\add* an exceeding good land.
\v 8 If the \nd LORD\nd* delight in vs, then he will bring vs into this land, and giue it vs, a land which floweth with milke and hony.
\v 9 Onely rebell not yee against the \nd LORD\nd*, neither feare yee the people of the land, for they \add are\add* bread for vs: their \f + \fr 14:9 \ft Hebr. shadow.\f*defence \add is\add* departed from them, and the \nd LORD\nd* is with vs: feare them not.
\v 10 But all the Congregation bade stone them with stones: and the glory of the \nd LORD\nd* appeared in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, before all the children of Israel.
\v 11 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it bee, yer they beleeue me, for all the signes which I haue shewed among them?
\v 12 I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherite them, and will make of thee a greater nation, and mightier then they.
\v 13 ¶ And \x + \xo 14:13 \xt Exod. 32.12.\x*Moses said vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, Then the Egyptians shall heare \add it\add*, (for thou broughtest vp this people in thy might from among them:)
\v 14 And they will tell \add it\add* to the inhabitants of this land: \add for\add* they haue heard that thou \nd LORD\nd* \add art\add* among this people, \add that\add* thou \nd LORD\nd* art seene face to face, and \add that\add* \x + \xo 14:14 \xt Exod. 13.21.\x*thy cloud standeth ouer them, and that thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.
\v 15 ¶ Now \add if\add* thou shalt kill \add all\add* this people, as one man, then the nations which haue heard the fame of thee, will speake, saying,
\v 16 Because the \nd LORD\nd* was not \x + \xo 14:16 \xt Deut. 9.28.\x*able to bring this people into the lande which he sware vnto them, therefore he hath slaine them in the wildernesse.
\v 17 And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my \nd LORD\nd* be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,
\v 18 The \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* \x + \xo 14:18 \xt Exod. 34.6. psal. 103.8.\x*long suffering, and of great mercie, forgiuing iniquitie and transgression, and by no meanes clearing the guiltie, \x + \xo 14:18 \xt Exod. 20.5. and 34.7.\x*visiting the iniquity of the fathers vpon the chldren, vnto the third and fourth \add generation\add*.
\v 19 Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquitie of this people, according vnto the greatnesse of thy mercie, and as thou hast forgiuen this people, from Egypt, euen \f + \fr 14:19 \ft Or, hitherto.\f*vntill now.
\v 20 And the \nd LORD\nd* said, I haue pardoned, according to thy word.
\v 21 But \add as\add* truly \add as\add* I liue, all the earth shalbe filled with the glory of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 22 Because all those men which haue seene my glory, and my miracles which I did in Egypt, and in the wildernesse, and haue tempted mee now these ten times, and haue not hearkened to my voice,
\v 23 \f + \fr 14:23 \ft Hebr. if they see the land.\f*Surely they shall not see the land which I sware vnto their fathers, neither shall any of them that prouoked me, see it.
\v 24 But my seruant \x + \xo 14:24 \xt Iosh. 14.6.\x*Caleb, because hee had another spirit with him, (and hath followed mee fully) him will I bring into the land, whereinto he went, and his seed shall possesse it.
\v 25 (Now the Amalekites, and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley) to morrow turne you and get you into the wildernesse, by the way of the Red sea.
\v 26 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto Moses, and vnto Aaron, saying,
\v 27 How long shall I beare with this euil congregation which murmure against mee? I haue heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmure against mee.
\v 28 Say vnto them, \x + \xo 14:28 \xt Chap. 26.65. and 32.10.\x*\add As truly as\add* I liue, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, as ye haue spoken in mine eares, so will I doe to you:
\v 29 Your carcases shall fall in this wildernesse, and all that were \x + \xo 14:29 \xt Deut. 1.35.\x*numbred of you, according to your whole number from twentie yeeres old and vpward, which haue murmured against mee,
\v 30 Doubtlesse ye shall not come into the land \add concerning\add* which I \f + \fr 14:30 \ft Heb. lifted vp my hand.\f*sware to make you dwell therein, saue Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh, and Ioshua the sonne of Nun.
\v 31 But your little ones, which yee said should be a pray, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye haue despised.
\v 32 But \add as for\add* you, your carkases, they shall fall in this wildernesse.
\v 33 And your children shall \f + \fr 14:33 \ft Or feed.\f*wander in the wildernes forty yeres, and beare your whoredomes, vntill your carkases be wasted in the wildernesse.
\v 34 After the number of the dayes in which ye searched the land, \add euen\add* \x + \xo 14:34 \xt Ezech. 4.6. psal. 95.19.\x*fortie dayes (each day for a yeere) shall yee beare your iniquities, \add euen\add* forty yeeres, and yee shall know my \f + \fr 14:34 \ft Or, altering of my purpose.\f*breach of promise.
\v 35 I the \nd LORD\nd* haue said, I will surely doe it vnto all this euill Congregation, that are gathered together against mee: in this wildernesse they shalbe consumed, & there they shall die.
\v 36 And the men which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the Congregation to murmure against him, by bringing vp a slander vpon the land,
\v 37 Euen those men that did bring vp the euill report vpon the land, \x + \xo 14:37 \xt 1.Cor. 10.10. Hebr. 3.10. iud. 5.\x*died by the plague, before the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 38 But Ioshua the sonne of Nun, and Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh, \add which were\add* of the men that went to search the land, liued \add still\add*.
\v 39 And Moses told these sayings vnto all the children of Israel, and the people mourned greatly.
\v 40 ¶ And they rose vp early in the morning, and gate them vp into the top of the mountaine, saying, Loe, we \x + \xo 14:40 \xt Deut. 1.41.\x*\add be here\add*, and will goe vp vnto the place which the \nd LORD\nd* hath promised: for we haue sinned.
\v 41 And Moses said, Wherefore now doe you transgresse the commaundement of the \nd LORD\nd*? but it shall not prosper.
\v 42 Goe not vp, for the \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* not among you, that ye be not smitten before your enemies.
\v 43 For the Amalekites, and the Canaanites \add are\add* there before you, and yee shall fall by the sword, because yee are turned away from the \nd LORD\nd*; therefore the \nd LORD\nd* will not bee with you.
\v 44 But they presumed to go vp vnto the hill top: neuertheles the Arke of the Couenant of the \nd LORD\nd*, and Moses departed not out of the campe.
\v 45 Then the Amalekites came downe, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and \x + \xo 14:45 \xt Deut. 1.44.\x*discomfited them, \add euen\add* vnto Hormah.

Hee that violated the Sabbath, is stoned. 37 The law of fringes.
\v 1 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto Moses, saying,
\v 2 \x + \xo 15:2 \xt Leuit. 23.10.\x*Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them, When ye be come into the land of your habitations, which I giue vnto you,
\v 3 And will make an offering by fire vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, a burnt offering or a sacrifice \x + \xo 15:3 \xt Leuit. 22.21.\x*in \f + \fr 15:3 \ft Heb. separating.\f*performing a vow, or in a free will offering, or in your solemne feasts, to make a \x + \xo 15:3 \xt Exod. 29.18.\x*sweet sauour vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, of the herd or of the flocke:

\v 5 And the fourth \add part\add* of an Hyn of wine for a drinke offring shalt thou prepare, with the burnt offering or sacrifice for one lambe.
\v 6 Or for a ramme, thou shalt prepare \add for\add* a meate offering two tenth deales of flowre mingled with the third \add part\add* of an Hyn of oyle.
\v 7 And for a drinke offering, thou shalt offer the third \add part\add* of an Hyn of wine, \add for\add* a sweete sauour vnto the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 8 And when thou preparest a bullocke \add for\add* a burnt offering, or \add for\add* a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings vnto the \nd LORD\nd*:
\v 9 Then shall hee bring with a bullocke a meate offering of three tenth deales of flowre, mingled with halfe an Hyn of oyle.
\v 10 And thou shalt bring for a drinke offering halfe an Hyn of wine, \add for\add* an offering made by fire of a sweet sauour vnto the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 11 Thus shall it be done for one bullocke, or for one ramme, or for a lambe, or a kidde.
\v 12 According to the number that yee shall prepare, so shall yee doe to euery one, according to their number.
\v 13 All that are borne of the countrey shall doe these things after this maner, in offering an offering made by fire of a sweet sauour, vnto the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 14 And if a stranger soiourne with you, or whosoeuer \add bee\add* among you in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire of a sweete sauour vnto the \nd LORD\nd*: as ye doe, so hee shall doe.
\v 15 \x + \xo 15:15 \xt Exod. 12.49. chap.9.14.\x*One ordinance \add shall be both\add* for you of the Congregation, and also for the stranger that soiourneth \add with you\add*, an ordinance for euer in your generations: as ye \add are\add*, so shall the stranger bee, before the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 16 One law, and one maner shall be for you, and for the stranger that soiourneth with you.
\v 17 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto Moses, saying,
\v 18 Speake vnto the children of Israel, and say vnto them, When ye come into the land whither I bring you,
\v 19 Then it shall be that when ye eate of the bread of the land, yee shall offer vp an heaue offring vnto the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 20 Ye shall offer vp a cake of the first of your dough, \add for\add* an heaue offring: as ye doe the heaue offering of the threshing floore, so shall ye heaue it.
\v 21 Of the first of your dough ye shal giue vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, an heaue offering in your generations.
\v 22 ¶ And if yee haue erred, and not obserued all these Commaundements which the \nd LORD\nd* hath spoken vnto Moses,
\v 23 Euen all that the \nd LORD\nd* hath commanded you, by the hand of Moses from the day that the \nd LORD\nd* commanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations:
\v 24 Then it shalbe, if \add ought\add* be committed by ignorance \f + \fr 15:24 \ft Hebr. from the eyes.\f*without the knowledge of the Congregation, that all the Congregation shall offer one yong bullocke for a burnt offering, for a sweet sauour vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, with his meate offering, and his drinke offering, according to the \f + \fr 15:24 \ft Or, ordinance.\f*manner, and one kid of the goats for a sinne offering.
\v 25 And the Priest shall make an atonement for all the Congregation of the children of Israel, and it shal be forgiuen them, for it \add is\add* ignorance: and they shall bring their offring, a sacrifice made by fire vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, and their sinne offering before the \nd LORD\nd*, for their ignorance.
\v 26 And it shall bee forgiuen all the Congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that soiourneth among them, seeing all the people \add were\add* in ignorance.

\v 28 And the Priest shall make an atonement for the soule that sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the \nd LORD\nd*, to make an atonement for him, & it shalbe forgiuen him.
\v 29 You shall haue one law for him that \f + \fr 15:29 \ft Hebr. doeth.\f*sinneth through ignorance, \add both for\add* him that is borne amongst the children of Israel, and for the stranger that soiourneth among them.

\v 31 Because he hath despised the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, and hath broken his commandement, that soule shall vtterly be cut off: his iniquitie \add shall be\add* vpon him.
\v 32 ¶ And while the children of Israel were in the wildernes, they found a man that gathered stickes vpon the Sabbath day.
\v 33 And they that found him gathering sticks, brought him vnto Moses and Aaron, and vnto all the Congregation.
\v 34 And they put him \x + \xo 15:34 \xt Leuit. 24.12.\x*in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him.

\v 36 And all the Cogregation brought him without the campe, and stoned him with stones, and he died, as the \nd LORD\nd* commanded Moses.

\iex 1 The rebellion of Korah, Dathan and Abiram, 23 Moses separateth the people from the rebels tents, 31 The earth swalloweth vp Korah, and a fire consumeth others. 36 The censers are reserued to holy vse. 41 Foureteene thousand and seuen hundred are slaine by a plague for murmuring against Moses and Aaron. 46 Aaron by incense stayeth the plague.
\v 1 ¶ Now \x + \xo 16:1 \xt Chap. 27.3. ecclus. 45.21. iud. 11.\x*Korah the sonne of Izhar, the sonne of Kohath, the sonne of Leui, and Dathan, and Abiram the sonnes of Eliab, and On the sonne of Peleth, sonnes of Reuben, tooke \add men\add*.
\v 2 And they rose vp before Moses, with certaine of the children of Israel, two hundred and fiftie Princes of the assembly, \x + \xo 16:2 \xt Chap. 26.9.\x*famous in the Congregation, men of renowne.
\v 3 And they gathered themselues together against Moses, and against Aaron, and said vnto them, \f + \fr 16:3 \ft Hebr.

\v 4 And when Moses heard \add it\add*, he fell vpon his face.
\v 5 And hee spake vnto Korah, and vnto all his company, saying, Euen to morrow the \nd LORD\nd* will shew who \add are\add* his, and \add who is\add* holy, and will cause \add him\add* to come neere vnto \add him\add*: euen him whom he hath chosen, will he cause to come neere vnto him.
\v 6 This doe: take you censers, Korah, and all his company:

\v 8 And Moses saide vnto Korah, Heare, I pray you, ye sonnes of Leui.
\v 9 \add Seemeth it but\add* a small thing vnto you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the Congregation of Israel, to bring you neere to himselfe, to doe the seruice of the Tabernacle of the \nd LORD\nd*, and to stand before the Congregation to minister vnto them?

\v 11 For which cause \add both\add* thou, and all thy company \add are\add* gathered together against the \nd LORD\nd*: and what \add is\add* Aaron, that ye murmure against him?

\v 15 And Moses was very wroth, and said vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, \x + \xo 16:15 \xt Gen. 4.4.\x*Respect not thou their offering: I haue not taken one asse from them, neither haue I hurt one of them.
\v 16 And Moses said vnto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the \nd LORD\nd*, thou, and they, and Aaron to morrow.
\v 17 And take euery man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring yee before the \nd LORD\nd* euery man his censer, two hundred and fiftie censers, thou also and Aaron, each \add of you\add* his censer.
\v 18 And they tooke euery man his censer, and put fire in them, and laide incense thereon, and stood in the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation with Moses and Aaron.
\v 19 And Korah gathered all the Congregation against them, vnto the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation: and the glory of the \nd LORD\nd* appeared vnto all the Congregation.
\v 20 And the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto Moses, and vnto Aaron, saying,
\v 21 Separate your selues from among this Congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.
\v 22 And they fell vpon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shal one man sinne, and wilt thou be wroth with all the Congregation?
\v 23 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto Moses, saying,
\v 24 Speake vnto the Congregation, saying, Get you vp from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.
\v 25 And Moses rose vp, and went vnto Dathan and Abiram: and the Elders of Israel followed him.
\v 26 And hee spake vnto the Congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sinnes.
\v 27 So they gate vp from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on euery side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the doore of their tents, and their wiues, & their sonnes, and their little children.
\v 28 And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the \nd LORD\nd* hath sent me to doe all these workes: for \add I haue\add* not \add done them\add* of mine owne mind.

\v 34 And all Israel that \add were\add* round about them, fled at the crie of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow vs vp \add also\add*.
\v 35 And there came out a fire from the \nd LORD\nd*, and consumed the two hundred and fiftie men that offered incense.
\v 36 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto Moses, saying,

\v 39 And Eleazar the Priest tooke the brasen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had offered, and they were made broad \add plates for\add* a couering of the Altar:
\v 40 To bee a memoriall vnto the children of Israel, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come neere to offer incense before the \nd LORD\nd*, that he be not as Korah, and as his company, as the \nd LORD\nd* said to him by the hand of Moses.
\v 41 ¶ But on the morrow, all the Congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye haue killed the people of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 42 And it came to passe when the Congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the Tabernacle of the Congregation: and behold, the cloud couered it, and the glory of the \nd LORD\nd* appeared.
\v 43 And Moses and Aaron came before the Tabernacle of the Congregation.
\v 44 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto Moses, saying,
\v 45 Get you vp from among this Congregation, that I may consume them, as in a moment: and they fell vpon their faces.
\v 46 ¶ And Moses said vnto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the Altar, and put on incense, and goe quickly vnto the Congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the \nd LORD\nd*; the plague is begun.
\v 47 And Aaron tooke as Moses commanded, and ranne into the midst of the Congregation: and behold, the plague was begun among the people, and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.
\v 48 And he stood betweene the dead and the liuing, and the plague was stayed.
\v 49 Now they that died in the plague, were foureteene thousand and seuen hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah.

\v 5 And the people spake against God and against Moses, Wherefore haue ye brought vs vp out of Egypt, to die in the wildernesse? for there is no bread, neither is there any water, and our soule \x + \xo 21:5 \xt Chap. 11.6.\x*loatheth this light bread.
\v 6 And \x + \xo 21:6 \xt Wisd. 16.1,5. 1.cor. 10.9.\x*the \nd LORD\nd* sent fierie serpents among the people, and they bit the people, and much people of Israel died.
\v 7 ¶ Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We haue sinned: for wee haue spoken against the \nd LORD\nd*, and against thee: pray vnto the \nd LORD\nd* that hee take away the serpents from vs: and Moses prayed for the people.
\v 8 And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Moses, Make thee a fierie serpent, and set it vpon a pole: and it shall come to passe, that euery one that is bitten, when hee looketh vpon it, shall liue.
\v 9 And \x + \xo 21:9 \xt 2.King. 18.4. ioh. 3.14.\x*Moses made a serpent of brasse, and put it vpon a pole, and it came to passe, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when hee beheld the serpent of brasse, he liued.
\v 10 ¶ And the children of Israel set forward, and \x + \xo 21:10 \xt Chap. 33.43.\x*pitched in Oboth.
\v 11 And they iourneyed from Oboth, and pitched at \f + \fr 21:11 \ft Or, heapes of Abarim.\f*Iie-Abarim, in the wildernes which \add is\add* before Moab, toward the Sunne rising.

\v 13 From thence they remooued, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which \add is\add* in the wildernesse that commeth out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon \add is\add* the border of Moab, betweene Moab and the Amorites.
\v 14 Wherefore it is said in the booke of the warres of the \nd LORD\nd*, \f + \fr 21:14 \ft Or, Vaheb in Suphah.\f*what he did in the Red sea, and in the brookes of Arnon,

\v 16 And from thence \add they went\add* to Beer: that \add is\add* the well whereof the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will giue them water.
\v 17 ¶ Then Israel sang this song, \f + \fr 21:17 \ft Heb. ascend\f*Spring vp O well, \f + \fr 21:17 \ft Or, answere.\f*Sing ye vnto it:
\v 18 The Princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by \add the direction of\add* the Law-giuer, with their staues. And from the wildernesse \add they went\add* to Mattanah:
\v 19 And from Mattanah, to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:

\v 21 ¶ And Israel sent messengers vnto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
\v 22 \x + \xo 21:22 \xt Deut. 2.27. iudges 11.19.\x*Let me passe thorow thy land, we will not turne into the fields, or into the vineyards, we will not drinke \add of\add* the waters of the well: \add but\add* we will goe along by the kings \add high\add* way, vntill wee be past thy borders.
\v 23 \x + \xo 21:23 \xt Deut. 29.7.\x*And Sihon would not suffer Israel to passe thorow his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wildernes: and he came to Iahaz, and fought against Israel.
\v 24 And \x + \xo 21:24 \xt Iosh. 12.2. psal. 135.11. amos 29.\x*Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon vnto Iabok, euen vnto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon \add was\add* strong.
\v 25 And Israel tooke all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the \f + \fr 21:25 \ft Hebr. daughters.\f*villages thereof.
\v 26 For Heshbon \add was\add* the citie of Sihon the King of the Amorites, who had fought against the former King of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, euen vnto Arnon.
\v 27 Wherefore they that speake in prouerbes, say, Come into Heshbon: let the citie of Sihon bee built and prepared.
\v 28 For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the citie of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, \add and\add* the lordes of the high places of Arnon.
\v 29 Woe to thee, Moab, thou art vndone, O people of \x + \xo 21:29 \xt 1.King. 11.7,33.\x*Chemosh: he hath giuen his sonnes that escaped, and his daughters, into captiuitie vnto Sihon King of the Amorites.
\v 30 We haue shot at them; Heshbon is perished euen vnto Dibon, and we haue layde them waste euen vnto Nophah, which \add reacheth\add* vnto Medeba.
\v 31 ¶ Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.
\v 32 And Moses sent to spy out Iaazer, and they tooke the villages thereof, and droue out the Amorites that \add were\add* there.
\v 33 ¶ \x + \xo 21:33 \xt Deut. 3.1. and 29.7.\x*And they turned and went vp by the way of Bashan: and Og the King of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battell at Edrei.
\v 34 And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Moses, Feare him not: for I haue deliuered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land, and \x + \xo 21:34 \xt Psal. 135.11.\x*thou shalt doe to him as thou didst vnto Sihon King of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.
\v 35 So they smote him & his sonnes, and all his people, vntill there was none left him aliue, and they possessed his land.

\iex 1 Balaks first message for Balaam is refused. 15 His second message obtaineth him. 22 An Angel would haue slaine him, if his asse had not saued him. 36 Balak intertaineth him.
\v 1 ¶ And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plaines of Moab, on this side Iordane \add by\add* Iericho.
\v 2 ¶ And Balak the sonne of Zippor, saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
\v 3 And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they \add were\add* many, and Moab was distressed, because of the children of Israel.
\v 4 And Moab said vnto the elders of Midian; Now shall this company licke vp all \add that are\add* round about vs, as the oxe licketh vp the grasse of the field. And Balak the sonne of Zippor, \add was\add* King of the Moabites at that time.
\v 5 \x + \xo 22:5 \xt Iosh. 24.9.\x*He sent messengers therefore vnto Balaam the sonne of Beor, to Pethor, which \add is\add* by the riuer of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: beholde, they couer the \f + \fr 22:5 \ft Hebr. eye.\f*face of the earth, and they abide ouer against me.
\v 6 Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse mee this people, for they \add are\add* too mightie for me: peraduenture I shall preuaile, \add that\add* we may smite them, and \add that\add* I may driue them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest, \add is\add* blessed, and hee whom thou cursest, is cursed.
\v 7 And the elders of Moab, and the elders of Midian departed, with the rewards of diuination in their hand; and they came vnto Balaam, and spake vnto him the words of Balak.
\v 8 And hee said vnto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word againe as the \nd LORD\nd* shal speake vnto mee: and the Princes of Moab abode with Balaam.
\v 9 And God came vnto Balaam, and said, What men \add are\add* these with thee?
\v 10 And Balaam said vnto God, Balak the sonne of Zippor, King of Moab, hath sent vnto me, \add saying\add*;
\v 11 Behold, \add there is\add* a people come out of Egypt, which couereth the face of the earth: Come now, curse me them; peraduenture \f + \fr 22:11 \ft Hebr. I shall preuaile in fighting against him.\f*I shalbe able to ouercome them, and driue them out.
\v 12 And God saide vnto Balaam; Thou shalt not goe with them, thou shalt not curse the people: for they \add are\add* blessed.
\v 13 And Balaam rose vp in the morning, and said vnto the Princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the \nd LORD\nd* refuseth to giue mee leaue to goe with you.
\v 14 And the Princes of Moab rose vp, and they went vnto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with vs.
\v 15 ¶ And Balak sent yet againe Princes, moe, and more honourable then they.
\v 16 And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor; \f + \fr 22:16 \ft Hebr. Be not thou letted from &c.\f*Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from comming vnto me:
\v 17 For I wil promote thee vnto very great honour, and I will do whatsoeuer thou saiest vnto me: Come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.
\v 18 And Balaam answered and said vnto the seruants of Balak, \x + \xo 22:18 \xt Chap. 24.13.\x*If Balak would giue me his house full of siluer and gold, I cannot goe beyond the word of the \nd LORD\nd* my God, to doe lesse or more.
\v 19 Now therefore, I pray you, tarie yee also here this night, that I may know what the \nd LORD\nd* will say vnto me more.
\v 20 And God came vnto Balaam at night, and said vnto him, If the men come to call thee, rise vp, \add and\add* goe with them: but yet the word which I shall say vnto thee, that shalt thou doe.
\v 21 And Balaam rose vp in the morning, and sadled his asse, and went with the princes of Moab.
\v 22 ¶ And Gods anger was kindled, because he went: and the Angel of the \nd LORD\nd* stood in the way for an aduersarie against him: Now he was riding vpon his asse, and his two seruants \add were\add* with him.
\v 23 And \x + \xo 22:23 \xt 2.Pet. 2.16. iude 11.\x*the Asse sawe the Angel of the \nd LORD\nd* standing in the way, and his sword drawen in his hand: and the asse turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the asse, to turne her into the way.
\v 24 But the Angel of the \nd LORD\nd* stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall \add being\add* on this side, & a wall on that side.
\v 25 And when the asse saw the Angel of the \nd LORD\nd*, she thrust her selfe vnto the wall, and crusht Balaams foote against the wall: and hee smote her againe.
\v 26 And the Angel of the \nd LORD\nd* went further, and stood in a narrowe place, where \add was\add* no way to turne, either to the right hand, or to the left.
\v 27 And when the asse sawe the Angel of the \nd LORD\nd*, shee fell downe vnder Balaam, and Balaams anger was kindled, and hee smote the asse with a staffe.
\v 28 And the \nd LORD\nd* opened the mouth of the asse, and shee saide vnto Balaam, What haue I done vnto thee, that thou hast smitten mee these three times?
\v 29 And Balaam said vnto the asse, Because thou hast mocked mee: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.
\v 30 And the asse said vnto Balaam, \add Am\add* not I thine asse, \f + \fr 22:30 \ft Hebr. who hast ridden vpon me.\f*vpon which thou hast ridden \f + \fr 22:30 \ft Or, euer since thou wast, &c.\f*euer since \add I was\add* thine, vnto this day? was I euer wont to do so vnto thee? And he said, Nay.
\v 31 Then the \nd LORD\nd* opened the eyes of Balaam, and hee saw the Angel of the \nd LORD\nd* standing in the way, and his sword drawen in his hand: and hee bowed downe his head, and \f + \fr 22:31 \ft Bowed himselfe.\f*fell flat on his face.
\v 32 And the Angel of the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine asse these three times? Behold, I went out \f + \fr 22:32 \ft Hebr. to be an aduersarie vnto thee\f*to withstand thee, because \add thy\add* way is peruerse before me.
\v 33 And the asse saw me, and turned from me these three times: vnlesse shee had turned from me, surely now also I had slaine thee, and saued her aliue.
\v 34 And Balaam said vnto the Angel of the \nd LORD\nd*, I haue sinned: for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against mee: Now therefore if it \f + \fr 22:34 \ft Heb. be euill in thine eyes.\f*displease thee, I will get mee backe againe.
\v 35 And the Angel of the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Balaam, Goe with the men: but onely the word that I shall speake vnto thee, that thou shalt speake: So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.
\v 36 ¶ And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, hee went out to meete him, vnto a citie of Moab, which \add is\add* in the border of Arnon, which \add is\add* in the vtmost coast.
\v 37 And Balak said vnto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send vnto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not vnto me? Am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?
\v 38 And Balaam saide vnto Balak, Loe, I am come vnto thee: haue I now any power at all to say any thing? the worde that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speake.
\v 39 And Balaam went with Balak, and they came vnto \f + \fr 22:39 \ft Or, a citie of streets.\f*Kiriath-Huzoth.
\v 40 And Balak offered oxen, and sheepe, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that \add were\add* with him.

\v 2 And Balak did as Balaam had spoken, and Balak & Balaam offered on \add euery\add* altar a bullocke and a ramme.
\v 3 And Balaam said vnto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offring, and I wil goe: peraduenture the \nd LORD\nd* will come to meete mee; and whatsoeuer he sheweth me, I will tell thee. And \f + \fr 23:3 \ft Or, he went solitary.\f*he went to an high place.
\v 4 And God met Balaam, and he said vnto him, I haue prepared seuen altars, and I haue offered vpon \add euery\add* altar a bullocke and a ramme.
\v 5 And the \nd LORD\nd* put a word in Balaams mouth, and said, Returne vnto Balak, & thus thou shalt speake.
\v 6 And he returned vnto him, and loe, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, hee, and all the Princes of Moab.
\v 7 And he tooke vp his parable, and said, Balak the King of Moab hath brought mee from Aram, out of the mountaines of the East, \add saying\add*, Come, curse me Iacob, and come, defie Israel.
\v 8 How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defie, \add whom\add* the \nd LORD\nd* hath not defied?

\v 12 And he answered, and said, Must I not take heede to speake that which the \nd LORD\nd* hath put in my mouth?
\v 13 And Balak said vnto him, Come, I pray thee, with me, vnto another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the vtmost part of them, and shalt not see them all: and curse me them from thence.
\v 14 ¶ And hee brought him into the fielde of Zophim, to the toppe of \f + \fr 23:14 \ft Or, the hill.\f*Pisgah, and built seuen altars, and offered a bullocke and a ramme on \add euery\add* altar.
\v 15 And he said vnto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meete the \nd LORD\nd* yonder.

\v 17 And when hee came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offring, and the Princes of Moab with him. And Balak said vnto him, What hath the \nd LORD\nd* spoken?
\v 18 And he tooke vp his parable, and said, Rise vp Balak, & heare; hearken vnto me, thou sonne of Zippor:
\v 19 God \add is\add* not a man that he should lie, neither the sonne of man, that hee should repent: hath he said, and shall he not doe \add it\add*? or, hath hee spoken, and shall he not make it good?
\v 20 Behold, I haue receiued commandement to blesse: and hee hath blessed, and I cannot reuerse it.
\v 21 Hee hath not beheld iniquitie in Iacob, neither hath he seene peruersenesse in Israel: the \nd LORD\nd* his God \add is\add* with him, and the shoute of a King \add is\add* among them.

\v 26 But Balaam answered, and said vnto Balak, Told not I thee, saying, All that the \nd LORD\nd* speaketh, that I must doe?
\v 27 ¶ And Balak saide vnto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee vnto another place, peraduenture it will please God, that thou mayest curse me them from thence.
