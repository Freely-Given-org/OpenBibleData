\iex 1 The children of Israel after Iosephs death do multiply. 8 The more they are oppressed by a new King, the more they multiply. 15 The godlines of the Midwiues, in sauing the men children aliue. 22 Pharaoh commandeth the male children to be cast into the riuer.
\v 1 ¶ Nowe these \add are\add* the names of the \x + \xo 1:1 \xt Gen. 46.8. exod. 6.14.\x*children of Israel, which came into Egypt, euery man & his household, came with Iacob.
\v 2 Reuben, Simeon, Leui, and Iudah,
\v 3 Issachar, Zebulun and Beniamin,
\v 4 Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.
\v 5 And all the soules that came out of the \f + \fr 1:5 \ft Heb. thigh.\f*loynes of Iacob, were \x + \xo 1:5 \xt Gen. 46.27. deut. 10.22.\x*seuentie soules: for Ioseph was in Egypt \add already\add*.
\v 6 And Ioseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.
\v 7 ¶ \x + \xo 1:7 \xt Acts. 7.17.\x*And the children of Israel were fruitfull, and increased aboundantly, and multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty, and the land was filled with them.
\v 8 Now there arose vp a new King ouer Egypt, which knew not Ioseph.
\v 9 And he said vnto his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel \add are\add* moe and mightier then we.
\v 10 Come on, let vs deale wisely with them, lest they multiply, and it come to passe that when there falleth out any warre, they ioyne also vnto our enemies, and fight against vs, and \add so\add* get them vp out of the land.
\v 11 Therefore they did set ouer them task-masters, to afflict them with their burdens: And they built for Pharaoh treasure-cities, Pithom and Raamses.
\v 12 \f + \fr 1:12 \ft Hebr. and as they afflicted them, so they multiplied, &c.\f*But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew: and they were grieued because of the children of Israel.
\v 13 And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serue with rigour.
\v 14 And they made their liues bitter, with hard bondage, in morter and in bricke, and in all maner of seruice in the fielde: all their seruice wherein they made them serue, \add was\add* with rigour.
\v 15 ¶ And the King of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwiues, (of which the name of one \add was\add* Shiphrah, and the name of t other Puah.)
\v 16 And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew-women, and see \add them\add* vpon the stooles, if it \add be\add* a sonne, then ye shall kill him: but if it \add be\add* a daughter, then shee shall liue.
\v 17 But the midwiues feared God, and did not as the King of Egypt commanded them, but saued the men children aliue.
\v 18 And the King of Egypt called for the midwiues, & said vnto them, Why haue ye done this thing, and haue saued the men children aliue?
\v 19 And the midwiues said vnto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women \add are\add* not as the Egyptian women: for they \add are\add* liuely, and are deliuered ere the midwiues come in vnto them.
\v 20 Therefore God dealt well with the midwiues: and the people multiplied and waxed very mighty.
\v 21 And it came to passe, because the midwiues feared God, that hee made them houses.
\v 22 And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Euery sonne that is borne, yee shall cast into the riuer, and euery daughter ye shall saue aliue.

\iex 1 Moses is borne, 3 and in an arke cast into the flags. 5 He is found, and brought vp by Pharaohs daughter. 11 He slayeth an Egyptian. 13 He reproueth an Hebrew. 15 He fleeth into Midian. 21 Hee marrieth Zipporah. 22 Gershom is borne. 23 God respecteth the Israelites cry.
\v 1 ¶ And there went \x + \xo 2:1 \xt Chap. 6.20. num. 26.59.\x*a man of the house of Leui, & tooke \add to wife\add* a daughter of Leui.
\v 2 And the woman conceiued, and bare a sonne: and when shee saw him that hee \add was a\add* goodly childe, shee \x + \xo 2:2 \xt Acts 7.20. heb. 11.23.\x*hid him three moneths.
\v 3 And when shee could not longer hide him, she tooke for him an arke of bul-rushes, and daubed it with slime, and with pitch, and put the childe therein, and shee layd \add it\add* in the flags by the riuers brinke.
\v 4 And his sister stood afarre off, to wit what would be done to him.
\v 5 ¶ And the daughter of Pharaoh came downe to wash her selfe at the riuer, and her maydens walked along by the riuer side: and when shee saw the arke among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.
\v 6 And when she had opened \add it\add*, she saw the childe: and beholde, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This \add is one\add* of the Hebrewes children.
\v 7 Then said his sister to Pharaohs daughter, Shall I goe, and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew-women, that she may nurse the childe for thee?
\v 8 And Pharaohs daughter said to her, Goe: And the mayd went and called the childs mother.
\v 9 And Pharaohs daughter said vnto her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will giue \add thee\add* thy wages. And the woman tooke the childe, and nursed it.
\v 10 And the childe grew, and shee brought him vnto Pharaohs daughter, and he became her sonne. And she called his name \f + \fr 2:10 \ft That is, Drawen out.\f*Moses: And she said, Because I drew him out of the water.
\v 11 ¶ And it came to passe in those dayes, when Moses was growen, that he went out vnto his brethren, and looked on their burdens, and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.
\v 12 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that \add there was\add* no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.
\v 13 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrewes stroue together: And hee said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?
\v 14 And he said, Who made thee \f + \fr 2:14 \ft Hebr. a Man a Prince.\f*a Prince and a iudge ouer vs? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is knowen.
\v 15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sate downe by a well.
\v 16 Now the \f + \fr 2:16 \ft Or, Prince.\f*Priest of Midian had seuen daughters, and they came and drew \add water\add*, and filled the troughes to water their fathers flocke.
\v 17 And the shepheards came and droue them away: but Moses stood vp and helped them, & watred their flocke.
\v 18 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How \add is it that\add* you are come so soone to day?
\v 19 And they said, An Egyptian deliuered vs out of the hand of the shepheards, and also drew \add water\add* enough for vs, and watered the flocke.
\v 20 And he said vnto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that yee haue left the man? Call him, that hee may eate bread.
\v 21 And Moses was content to dwel with the man, and he gaue Moses Zipporah his daughter.
\v 22 And she bare \add him\add* a sonne, and he called his name \x + \xo 2:22 \xt Chap. 18.3.\x*Gershom: for he said, I haue bene a stranger in a strange land.
\v 23 ¶ And it came to passe in processe of time, that the king of Egypt died, and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came vp vnto God, by reason of the bondage.
\v 24 And God heard their groning, and God remembred his \x + \xo 2:24 \xt Gene. 15.14. and 46.4.\x*Couenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Iacob.
\v 25 And God looked vpon the children of Israel, and God \f + \fr 2:25 \ft Heb. knew.\f*had respect vnto \add them\add*.

\iex 1 Moses keepeth Iethros flocke. 2 God appeareth to him in a burning bush. 9 He sendeth him to deliuer Israel. 14 The name of God. 15 His message to Israel.
\v 1 ¶ Nowe Moses kept the flocke of Iethro his father in law, the Priest of Midian: and hee led the flocke to the backeside of the desert, and came to the mountaine of God, \add euen\add* to Horeb.
\v 2 And the Angel of the \nd LORD\nd* appeared vnto him, in a \x + \xo 3:2 \xt A&s. 7.30.\x*flame of fire out of the midst of a bush, and he looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush \add was\add* not consumed.
\v 3 And Moses saide, I will nowe turne aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.
\v 4 And when the \nd LORD\nd* sawe that he turned aside to see, God called vnto him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he saide, Here \add am\add* I.
\v 5 And he said, Drawe not nigh hither: \x + \xo 3:5 \xt Iosh. 5.15. acts. 7.53.\x*put off thy shooes from off thy feete, for the place whereon thou standest, \add is\add* holy ground.
\v 6 Moreouer hee said, \x + \xo 3:6 \xt Matth. 22.32. acts. 7.32.\x*I \add am\add* the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Iacob. And Moses hid his face: for he was afraid to looke vpon God.
\v 7 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said, I haue surely seene the affliction of my people which \add are\add* in Egypt, and haue heard their crie, by reason of their taske-masters: for I know their sorrowes,
\v 8 And I am come downe to deliuer them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them vp out of that land, vnto a good land and a large, vnto a lande flowing with milke and hony, vnto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hiuites, and the Iebusites.
\v 9 Now therefore behold, the crie of the children of Israel is come vnto me: and I haue also seene the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppresse them.
\v 10 Come now therefore, and I will send thee vnto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.
\v 11 ¶ And Moses saide vnto God, Who \add am\add* I, that I should goe vnto Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?
\v 12 And he said, Certainely I will be with thee, and this \add shall be\add* a token vnto thee, that I haue sent thee: When thou hast brought foorth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serue God vpon this mountaine.
\v 13 And Moses saide vnto God, Behold, \add when\add* I come vnto the children of Israel, and shall say vnto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me vnto you; and they shall say to me, What \add is\add* his name? what shall I say vnto them?
\v 14 And God saide vnto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: And he said, Thus shalt thou say vnto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me vnto you.
\v 15 And God said moreouer vnto Moses, Thus shalt thou say vnto the children of Israel; The \nd LORD\nd* God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Iacob hath sent me vnto you: this \add is\add* my name for euer, and this \add is\add* my memoriall vnto all generations.
\v 16 Goe and gather the Elders of Israel together, and say vnto them, The \nd LORD\nd* God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Iacob appeared vnto me, saying, I haue surely visited you, and seene that which is done to you in Egypt.
\v 17 And I haue said, I will bring you vp out of the affliction of Egypt, vnto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hiuites, and the Iebusites, vnto a land flowing with milke and hony.
\v 18 And they shall hearken to thy voyce: and thou shalt come, thou and the Elders of Israel vnto the King of Egypt, and you shall say vnto him, The \nd LORD\nd* God of the Hebrewes hath met with vs: and now let vs goe, (wee beseech thee) three dayes iourney into the wildernes, that we may sacrifice to the \nd LORD\nd* our God.
\v 19 ¶ And I am sure that the King of Egypt will not let you goe, \f + \fr 3:19 \ft Or, but by strong hand.\f*no not by a mightie hand.
\v 20 And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will doe in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you goe.
\v 21 And I will giue this people fauour in the sight of the Egyptians, and it shall come to passe that when ye goe, ye shall not goe empty:
\v 22 \x + \xo 3:22 \xt Chap. 11.2. & 12.35.\x*But euery woman shal borrow of her neighbour, and of her that soiourneth in her house, iewels of siluer, and iewels of gold, and rayment: and ye shall put \add them\add* vpon your sonnes and vpon your daughters, and yee shall spoile \f + \fr 3:22 \ft Or, Egypt.\f*the Egyptians.

\iex 1 Moses rod is turned into a Serpent. 6 His hand is leprous. 10 He is loath to bee sent. 14 Aaron is appointed to assist him. 18 Moses departeth from Iethro. 21 Gods message to Pharaoh. 24 Zipporah circumciseth her sonne. 27 Aaron is sent to meet Moses. 31 The people beleeueth them.
\v 1 ¶ And Moses answered, and said, But behold, they will not beleeue mee, nor hearken vnto my voice: for they will say, The \nd LORD\nd* hath not appeared vnto thee.
\v 2 And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto him, What \add is\add* that in thine hand? and hee said, A rod.
\v 3 And he said, Cast it on the ground: And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent: and Moses fled from before it.
\v 4 And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Moses, Put forth thine hand, and take it by the taile: And he put foorth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand:
\v 5 That they may beleeue that the \nd LORD\nd* God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Iacob hath appeared vnto thee.
\v 6 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said furthermore vnto him, Put now thine hand into thy bosome. And he put his hand into his bosome: and when hee tooke it out, behold, his hand \add was\add* leprous as snowe.
\v 7 And he said, Put thine hand into thy bosome againe. And hee put his hand into his bosome againe, and plucked it out of his bosome, and behold, it was turned againe as his \add other\add* flesh.
\v 8 And it shall come to passe, if they wil not beleeue thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first signe, that they will beleeue the voice of the latter signe.
\v 9 And it shall come to passe, if they will not beleeue also these two signes, neither hearken vnto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the riuer, and powre \add it\add* vpon the drie \add land\add*: and the water which thou takest out of the riuer, \f + \fr 4:9 \ft Heb. shalbe and shall be.\f*shall become blood vpon the drie \add land\add*.
\v 10 ¶ And Moses saide vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, O my lord, I \add am\add* not \f + \fr 4:10 \ft Heb. a man of words.\f*eloquent, neither heretofore, nor \f + \fr 4:10 \ft Heb. since yesterday nor since the third day.\f*since thou hast spoken vnto thy seruant: but I \add am\add* slow of speach, and of a slow tongue.
\v 11 And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto him, Who hath made mans mouth? or who maketh the dumbe or deafe, or the seeing, or y\sup e\sup* blind? haue not I the \nd LORD\nd*?
\v 12 Now therefore goe, and I will be \x + \xo 4:12 \xt Matth. 10.19. mar. 13.11. luk. 12.11.\x*with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say.
\v 13 And he said, O my \nd LORD\nd*, send, I pray thee, by the hand \add of him whom\add* thou \f + \fr 4:13 \ft Or, shouldest.\f*wilt send.
\v 14 And the anger of the \nd LORD\nd* was kindled against Moses, and hee said, \add Is\add* not Aaron the Leuite thy brother? I know that he can speake well. And also behold, he commeth foorth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, hee will be glad in his heart.
\v 15 And thou shalt speake vnto him, and put words in his mouth, and I wil be with thy mouth, & with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall doe.
\v 16 And he shal be thy spokesman vnto the people: and he shall be, \add euen\add* hee shall be to thee in stead of a mouth, and \x + \xo 4:16 \xt Chap. 7.1.\x*thou shalt be to him in stead of God.
\v 17 And thou shalt take this rod in thine hand, wherewith thou shalt doe signes.
\v 18 ¶ And Moses went and returned to Iethro his father in law, and said vnto him, Let me goe, I pray thee, and returne vnto my brethren, which \add are\add* in Egypt, and see whether they bee yet aliue. And Iethro said to Moses, Goe in peace.
\v 19 And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Moses in Midian, Goe, returne into Egypt: for all the men are dead which sought thy life.
\v 20 And Moses tooke his wife, and his sonnes, and set them vpon an asse, and he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses tooke the rod of God in his hand.
\v 21 And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Moses, When thou goest to returne into Egypt, see that thou doe all those wonders before Pharaoh, which I haue put in thine hand: but I wil harden his heart, that hee shall not let the people goe.
\v 22 And thou shalt say vnto Pharaoh, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Israel \add is\add* my sonne, \add euen\add* my first borne.
\v 23 And I say vnto thee, let my sonne goe, that he may serue mee: and if thou refuse to let him goe, behold, I will slay thy sonne, \add euen\add* thy first borne.
\v 24 ¶ And it came to passe by the way in the Inne, that the \nd LORD\nd* met him, and sought to kill him.
\v 25 Then Zipporah tooke a sharpe \f + \fr 4:25 \ft Or, knife.\f*stone, and cut off the foreskinne of her sonne, and \f + \fr 4:25 \ft Heb. made it touch.\f*cast \add it\add* at his feete, and said, Surely a bloody husband \add art\add* thou to mee.
\v 26 So he let him goe: then she said, A bloody husband \add thou art\add*, because of the Circumcision.
\v 27 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said to Aaron, Goe into the wildernesse to meete Moses. And hee went and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him.
\v 28 And Moses tolde Aaron all the wordes of the \nd LORD\nd*, who had sent him, and all the signes which hee had commanded him.
\v 29 ¶ And Moses and Aaron went, and gathered together all the elders of the children of Israel.
\v 30 And Aaron spake all the wordes which the \nd LORD\nd* had spoken vnto Moses, and did the signes in the sight of the people.
\v 31 And the people beleeued: And when they heard that the \nd LORD\nd* had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked vpon their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.

\iex 1 Pharaoh chideth Moses and Aaron for their message. 5 Hee encreaseth the Israelites taske. 15 Hee checketh their complaints. 19 They cry out vpon Moses and Aaron. 22 Moses complaineth to God.
\v 1 ¶ And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and tolde Pharaoh, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, Let my people goe, that they may holde a feast vnto mee in the wildernesse.
\v 2 And Pharaoh said, Who \add is\add* the \nd LORD\nd*, that I should obey his voyce to let Israel goe? I know not the \nd LORD\nd*, neither will I let Israel goe.
\v 3 And they said, \x + \xo 5:3 \xt Chap. 3.18.\x*The God of the Hebrewes hath met with vs: let vs goe, we pray thee, three dayes iourney into the desert, and sacrifice vnto the \nd LORD\nd* our God, lest hee fall vpon vs with pestilence, or with the sword.
\v 4 And the King of Egypt said vnto them, Wherfore doe ye, Moses and Aaron, let the people from their workes? get you vnto your burdens.
\v 5 And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now \add are\add* many, & you make them rest from their burdens.
\v 6 And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taske-masters of the people, and their officers, saying;
\v 7 Yee shall no more giue the people straw to make bricke, as heretofore: let them goe and gather straw for themselues.
\v 8 And the tale of the brickes which they did make heretofore, you shall lay vpon them: you shall not diminish \add ought\add* thereof: for they \add be\add* idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us goe \add and\add* sacrifice to our God.
\v 9 \f + \fr 5:9 \ft Heb. let the worke be heauy vpon the men.\f*Let there more worke be layde vpon the men, that they may labour therein, and let them not regard vaine wordes.
\v 10 ¶ And the taske-masters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spake to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not giue you straw.
\v 11 Goe ye, get you straw where you can find it: yet not ought of your worke shall be diminished.
\v 12 So the people were scattered abroad throughout al the land of Egypt, to gather stubble in stead of straw.
\v 13 And the taske-masters hasted \add them\add*, saying; Fulfill \add your\add* workes, your \f + \fr 5:13 \ft Hebr. a matter of a day in his day.\f*dayly taskes, as when there was straw.
\v 14 And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaohs task-masters had set ouer them, were beaten, \add and\add* demanded, Wherefore haue ye not fulfilled your taske, in making bricke, both yesterday and to day, as heretofore?
\v 15 ¶ Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cryed vnto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy seruants?
\v 16 There is no straw giuen vnto thy seruants, and they say to vs, Make bricke: and beholde, thy seruants \add are\add* beaten; but the fault \add is\add* in thine owne people.
\v 17 But he said, Ye \add are\add* idle, \add ye are\add* idle: therefore ye say, Let vs goe \add and\add* doe sacrifice to the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 18 Goe therefore now \add and\add* worke: for there shall no straw bee giuen you, yet shall ye deliuer the tale of brickes.
\v 19 And the officers of the children of Israel did see \add that\add* they \add were\add* in euill \add case\add*, after it was said, Yee shall not minish \add ought\add* from your brickes of your dayly taske.
\v 20 ¶ And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came foorth from Pharaoh.
\v 21 And they said vnto them; The \nd LORD\nd* looke vpon you, and iudge, because you haue made our sauour \f + \fr 5:21 \ft Hebr. to stinke.\f*to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his seruants, to put a sword in their hand to slay vs.
\v 22 And Moses returned vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, and said, \nd LORD\nd*, Wherefore hast thou \add so\add* euill intreated this people? Why \add is\add* it \add that\add* thou hast sent me?
\v 23 For since I came to Pharaoh to speake in thy Name, he hath done euill to this people, neither hast thou \f + \fr 5:23 \ft Heb. deliuering thou hast not deliuered.\f*deliuered thy people at all.

\iex 1 God renueth his promise by his Name IEHOVAH. 14 The genealogie of Reuben, 15 of Simeon, 16 of Leui, of whom came Moses and Aaron.
\v 1 ¶ Then the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will doe to Pharaoh: for with a strong hand shall hee let them goe, and with a strong hand shall he driue them out of his land.
\v 2 And God spake vnto Moses, and said vnto him, I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 3 And I appeared vnto Abraham, vnto Isaac, and vnto Iacob, by the Name of God Almighty, but by my name IEHOVAH was I not knowen to them.
\v 4 And I haue also established my Couenant with them, to giue them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers.
\v 5 And I haue also heard the groning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keepe in bondage: and I haue remembred my Couenant.
\v 6 Wherefore say vnto the children of Israel, I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*, and I will bring you out from vnder the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage: and I will redeeme you with a stretched out arme, and with great iudgements.
\v 7 And I will take you to mee for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd* your God, which bringeth you out from vnder the burdens of the Egyptians.
\v 8 And I will bring you in vnto the lande concerning the which I did \f + \fr 6:8 \ft Heb. lift vp my hand.\f*sweare to giue it, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Iacob, and I will giue it you for an heritage, I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 9 ¶ And Moses spake so vnto the children of Israel: but they hearkened not vnto Moses, for \f + \fr 6:9 \ft Heb. shortnesse: or, straitnes.\f*anguish of spirit, and for cruell bondage.
\v 10 And the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto Moses, saying,
\v 11 Goe in, speake vnto Pharaoh King of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel goe out of his land.
\v 12 And Moses spake before the \nd LORD\nd*, saying, Behold, the children of Israel haue not hearkened vnto me: how then shal Pharaoh heare me, who \add am\add* of vncircumcised lips?
\v 13 And the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto Moses and vnto Aaron, & gaue them a charge vnto the children of Israel, and vnto Pharaoh King of Egypt, to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.

\v 29 That the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto Moses, saying, I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*: speake thou vnto Pharaoh king of Egypt, all that I say vnto thee.
\v 30 And Moses said before the \nd LORD\nd*, Behold, I \add am\add* of vncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hearken vnto mee?
\c 7
\iex 1 Moses is encouraged to go to Pharaoh. 7 His age. 8 His rod is turned into a Serpent. 11 The sorcerers do the like. 13 Pharaohs heart is hardened. 14 Gods message to Pharaoh. 19 The riuer is turned into blood.
\v 1 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Moses, See, I haue made thee a god to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy brother shalbe thy prophet.
\v 2 Thou shalt speake all that I command thee, and Aaron thy brother shall speake vnto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his land.
\v 3 And I will harden Pharaohs heart, and multiplie my signes and my wonders in the land of Egypt.
\v 4 But Pharaoh shall not hearken vnto you, that I may lay my hand vpon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, \add and\add* my people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt, by great iudgments.
\v 5 And the Egyptians shall knowe that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*, when I stretch forth mine hand vpon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from among them.
\v 6 And Moses and Aaron did as the \nd LORD\nd* commanded them, so did they.
\v 7 And Moses \add was\add* fourescore yeres olde, and Aaron fourescore and three yeeres old, when they spake vnto Pharaoh.
\v 8 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto Moses, and vnto Aaron, saying:
\v 9 When Pharaoh shall speake vnto you, saying, Shew a miracle for you: then thou shalt say vnto Aaron, Take thy rod and cast \add it\add* before Pharaoh, \add and\add* it shall become a serpent.
\v 10 ¶ And Moses and Aaron went in vnto Pharaoh, and they did so as the \nd LORD\nd* had commanded: and Aaron cast downe his rod before Pharaoh, and before his seruants, and it became a serpent.
\v 11 Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers; now the Magicians of Egypt, they also did in like maner with their enchantments.
\v 12 For they cast downe euery man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aarons rod swallowed vp their rods.
\v 13 And hee hardened Pharaohs heart, that hee hearkened not vnto them, as the \nd LORD\nd* had said.
\v 14 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* saide vnto Moses, Pharaohs heart \add is\add* hardened: he refuseth to let the people goe.
\v 15 Get thee vnto Pharaoh in the morning, loe, he goeth out vnto the water, and thou shalt stand by the riuers brinke, against hee come: and the rod which was turned to a serpent, shalt thou take in thine hand.
\v 16 And thou shalt say vnto him, The \nd LORD\nd* God of the Hebrewes hath sent me vnto thee, saying; Let my people goe, that they may serue mee in the wildernesse: and beholde, hitherto thou wouldest not heare.
\v 17 Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, In this thou shalt know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*: behold, I will smite with the rod that \add is\add* in my hand, vpon the waters which \add are\add* in the riuer, and they shalbe turned to blood.
\v 18 And the fish that \add is\add* in the riuer shall die, and the riuer shall stincke, and the Egyptians shall loathe to drinke of the water of the riuer.
\v 19 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto Moses, Say vnto Aaron, Take thy rod, & stretch out thine hand vpon the waters of Egypt, vpon their streames, vpon their riuers, and vpon their ponds, and vpon all their \f + \fr 7:19 \ft Heb.

\v 20 And Moses and Aaron did so, as the \nd LORD\nd* commanded: and he \x + \xo 7:20 \xt Chap. 17.5.\x*lift vp the rod and smote the waters that were in the riuer, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his seruants: and all the \x + \xo 7:20 \xt Psal. 78.44.\x*waters that \add were\add* in the riuer, \add were\add* turned to blood.
\v 21 And the fish that \add was\add* in the riuer died: and the riuer stunke, and the Egyptians could not drinke of the water of the riuer: and there was blood throughout all the land Egypt.
\v 22 \x + \xo 7:22 \xt Wis. 17.7.\x*And the Magicians of Egypt did so, with their enchantments: and Pharaohs heart was hardened, neither did he hearken vnto them, as the \nd LORD\nd* had said.
\v 23 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did hee set his heart to this also.
\v 24 And all the Egyptians digged round about the riuer for water to drinke: for they could not drinke of the water of the riuer.
\v 25 And seuen dayes were fulfilled after that the \nd LORD\nd* had smitten the riuer.

\iex 1 Frogges are sent. 8 Pharaoh sueth to Moses, 12 and Moses by prayer remoueth them away. 16 The dust is turned into lice, which the Magicians could not doe. 20 The swarmes of flies. 25 Pharaoh inclineth to let the people goe, 32 but yet is hardened.
\v 1 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto Moses, Goe vnto Pharaoh, and say vnto him; Thus sayeth the \nd LORD\nd*, Let my people goe, that they may serue me.
\v 2 And if thou refuse to let \add them\add* goe, beholde, I will smite all thy borders with frogges.
\v 3 And the riuer shall bring foorth frogges abundantly, which shall goe vp and come into thine house, and into thy bed-chamber, and vpon thy bed, and into the house of thy seruants, and vpon thy people, and into thine ouens, and into thy \f + \fr 8:3 \ft Or, dough.\f*kneading troughes.
\v 4 And the frogges shall come vp both on thee, and vpon thy people, and vpon all thy seruants.
\v 5 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto Moses; Say vnto Aaron, Stretch foorth thine hand with thy rodde ouer the streames, ouer the riuers, and ouer the ponds, and cause frogges to come vp vpon the land of Egypt.
\v 6 And Aaron stretched out his hand ouer the waters of Egypt, and the frogges came vp, and couered the land of Egypt.
\v 7 \x + \xo 8:7 \xt Wisd. 17.7.\x*And the Magicians did so with their inchantments, and brought vp frogges vpon the land of Egypt.
\v 8 ¶ Then Pharaoh called for Moses, and Aaron, and said, Intreat the \nd LORD\nd*, that hee may take away the frogges from me, and from my people: and I will let the people goe, that they may doe sacrifice vnto the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 9 And Moses saide vnto Pharaoh, \f + \fr 8:9 \ft Or haue this honour ouer me, &c.\f*Glory ouer mee: \f + \fr 8:9 \ft Or, against when.\f*when shall I entreat for thee, and for thy seruants, and for thy people, to \f + \fr 8:9 \ft Hebr. to cut off.\f*destroy the frogges from thee, and thy houses, \add that\add* they may remaine in the riuer onely?
\v 10 And he said, \f + \fr 8:10 \ft Or, against to morrow.\f*To morrow. And hee said, Bee it according to thy word: That thou mayest know that \add there is\add* none like vnto the \nd LORD\nd* our God.
\v 11 And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy seruants, and from thy people; they shall remaine in the riuer onely.
\v 12 And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried vnto the \nd LORD\nd* because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.
\v 13 And the \nd LORD\nd* did according to the word of Moses: and the frogges died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.
\v 14 And they gathered them together vpon heapes, and the land stanke.
\v 15 But when Pharaoh saw that there was respit, he hardned his heart, and hearkened not vnto them, as the \nd LORD\nd* had said.
\v 16 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* saide vnto Moses, Say vnto Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice, thorowout all the land of Egypt.
\v 17 And they did so: for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice, in man and in beast: all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
\v 18 And the Magicians did so with their enchantments to bring foorth lice, but they could not: so there were lice vpon man and vpon beast.
\v 19 Then the Magicians said vnto Pharaoh; This \add is\add* the singer of God. And Pharaohs heart was hardned, and he hearkened not vnto them, as the \nd LORD\nd* had said.
\v 20 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* saide vnto Moses, Rise vp early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh: loe, he commeth foorth to the water, and say vnto him; Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Let my people goe, that they may serue me.
\v 21 Els, if thou wilt not let my people goe, beholde, I will send \f + \fr 8:21 \ft Or, a mixture of noysome beasts, &c.\f*swarmes \add of flies\add* vpon thee, and vpon thy seruants, and vpon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall bee full of swarmes \add of flies\add*, and also the ground whereon they \add are\add*.
\v 22 And I will seuer in that day the lande of Goshen in which my people dwell, that no swarmes \add of flies\add* shall be there, to the end thou maiest know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd* in the midst of the earth.
\v 23 And I will put \f + \fr 8:23 \ft Hebr. a redemption.\f*a diuision betweene my people and thy people: \f + \fr 8:23 \ft Or, by to morrow.\f*to morrow shall this signe be.
\v 24 And the \nd LORD\nd* did so: and \x + \xo 8:24 \xt Wisd. 16.9.\x*there came a grieuous swarme \add of flies\add* \add into\add* the house of Pharaoh, and into his seruants houses, and into all the lande of Egypt: the land was \f + \fr 8:24 \ft Or, destroyed.\f*corrupted by reason of the swarme \add of flies\add*.
\v 25 ¶ And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Goe yee, sacrifice to your God in the land.
\v 26 And Moses said, It is not meete so to doe; for we shal sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians, to the \nd LORD\nd* our God: Loe, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone vs?
\v 27 We will goe three dayes iourney into the wildernesse, and sacrifice to the \nd LORD\nd* our God, as \x + \xo 8:27 \xt Chap. 3.18.\x*he shall command vs.
\v 28 And Pharaoh said, I wil let you goe that ye may sacrifice to the \nd LORD\nd* your God, in the wildernes: onely you shall not goe very farre away: intreate for me.
\v 29 And Moses said, Behold, I goe out from thee, and I will intreate the \nd LORD\nd* that the swarmes \add of flies\add* may depart from Pharaoh, from his seruants, and from his people to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deale deceitfully any more, in not letting the people goe to sacrifice to the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 30 And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the \nd LORD\nd*:
\v 31 And the \nd LORD\nd* did according to the word of Moses: and he remooued the swarmes \add of flies\add* from Pharaoh, from his seruants, and from his people: there remained not one.
\v 32 And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would hee let the people goe.

\iex 1 The murraine of beasts. 8 The plague of boyles, and blaines. 13 His message about the haile. 22 The plague of haile. 27 Pharaoh sueth to Moses, 35 but yet is hardened.
\v 1 ¶ Then the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Moses, Goe in vnto Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* God of the Hebrewes, Let my people goe, that they may serue me.
\v 2 For if thou refuse to let \add them\add* goe, and wilt hold them still,
\v 3 Behold, the hand of the \nd LORD\nd* is vpon thy cattell which \add is\add* in the field, vpon the horses, vpon the asses, vpon the camels, vpon the oxen, and vpon the sheepe: \add there shall be\add* a very grieuous murraine.
\v 4 And the \nd LORD\nd* shall seuer betweene the cattell of Israel, and the cattell of Egypt, and there shall nothing die of all \add that is\add* the childrens of Israel.
\v 5 And the \nd LORD\nd* appointed a set time, saying, To morrow the \nd LORD\nd* shall doe this thing in the land.
\v 6 And the \nd LORD\nd* did that thing on the morrow; and all the cattell of Egypt died, but of the cattell of the children of Israel died not one.
\v 7 And Pharaoh sent, and beholde, there was not one of the cattell of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people goe.
\v 8 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* saide vnto Moses, and vnto Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the fornace, and let Moses sprinkle it towards the heauen, in the sight of Pharaoh:
\v 9 And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall bee a boyle breaking forth \add with\add* blaines, vpon man and vpon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.
\v 10 And they tooke ashes of the fornace, and stood before Pharaoh, and Moses sprinkled it vp toward heauen: and it became a boile breaking forth \add with\add* blaines, vpon man and vpon beast.
\v 11 And the Magicians could not stand before Moses, because of the boiles: for the boile was vpon the magicians, and vpon all the Egyptians.
\v 12 And the \nd LORD\nd* hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and hee hearkened not vnto them, \x + \xo 9:12 \xt Chap. 4.21.\x*as the \nd LORD\nd* had spoken vnto Moses.
\v 13 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* saide vnto Moses, Rise vp earely in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say vnto him, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* God of the Hebrewes, Let my people goe, that they may serue me.
\v 14 For I will at this time send all my plagues vpon thine heart, and vpon thy seruants, and vpon thy people: that thou mayest knowe that \add there is\add* none like me in all the earth.
\v 15 For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people, with pestilence, and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.
\v 16 And in very deede, for \x + \xo 9:16 \xt Rom. 9.17.\x*this \add cause\add* haue I \f + \fr 9:16 \ft Heb. made thee stand.\f*raised thee vp, for to shewe \add in\add* thee my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.
\v 17 As yet exaltest thou thy selfe against my people, that thou wilt not let them goe?
\v 18 Behold, to morrow about this time, I wil cause it to raine a very grieuous haile, such as hath not bene in Egypt, since the foundation thereof euen vntill now.
\v 19 Send therefore now, \add and\add* gather thy cattell, and all that thou hast in the field: for vpon euery man and beast which shal be found in the field, and shal not bee brought home, the haile shall come downe vpon them, and they shall die.
\v 20 Hee that feared the word of the \nd LORD\nd* amongst the seruants of Pharaoh, made his seruants and his cattell flee into the houses.
\v 21 And he that \f + \fr 9:21 \ft Heb. set not his heart vnto.\f*regarded not the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, left his seruants and his cattell in the field.
\v 22 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* saide vnto Moses, Stretch forth thine hand toward heauen, that there may be haile in all the land of Egypt, vpon man and vpon beast, and vpon euery herbe of the field, thorowout the land of Egypt.
\v 23 And Moses stretched foorth his rod toward heauen, and the \nd LORD\nd* sent thunder and haile, and the fire ranne along vpon the ground, and the \nd LORD\nd* rained haile vpon the land of Egypt.
\v 24 So there was haile, and fire mingled with the haile, very grieuous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt, since it became a nation.
\v 25 And the haile smote throughout all the land of Egypt, all that \add was\add* in the field, both man and beast: and the haile smote euery herbe of the fielde, and brake euery tree of the field.
\v 26 Onely in the land of Goshen where the children of Israel \add were\add*, was there no haile.
\v 27 ¶ And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said vnto them, I haue sinned this time: the \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* righteous, and I and my people \add are\add* wicked.
\v 28 Entreat the \nd LORD\nd*, (for \add it is\add* enough) that there be no \add more\add* \f + \fr 9:28 \ft Hebr. voyces of God.\f*mighty thunderings and haile, and I will let you goe, and ye shall stay no longer.
\v 29 And Moses saide vnto him, Assoone as I am gone out of the citie, I will spread abroad my hands vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, \add and\add* the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more haile: that thou mayest know how that the \x + \xo 9:29 \xt Psal. 24.1.\x*earth \add is\add* the \nd LORD\nd*s.
\v 30 But as for thee and thy seruants, I know that ye will not yet feare the \nd LORD\nd* God.
\v 31 And the flaxe, and the barley was smitten: for the barley \add was\add* in the eare, and the flaxe \add was\add* bolled:
\v 32 But the wheat and the rye were not smitten: for they \add were\add* \f + \fr 9:32 \ft Hebr. hidden: or, darke.\f*not growen vp.
\v 33 And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands vnto the \nd LORD\nd*: and the thunders and haile ceased, and the raine was not powred vpon the earth.
\v 34 And when Pharaoh saw that the raine, and the haile and the thunders were ceased, hee sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his seruants.
\v 35 And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel goe, as the \nd LORD\nd* had spoken \f + \fr 9:35 \ft Hebr. by the hand of Moses.\f*by Moses.

\v 1 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Moses, Goe in vnto Pharaoh: for \x + \xo 10:1 \xt Chap. 4.21.\x*I haue hardned his heart, and the heart of his seruants, that I might shew these my signes before him:
\v 2 And that thou mayest tell in the eares of thy sonne, and of thy sonnes sonne, what things I haue wrought in Egypt, and my signes which I haue done amongst them, that ye may know how that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 3 And Moses and Aaron came in vnto Pharaoh, and saide vnto him, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* God of the Hebrewes, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thy selfe before mee? Let my people goe, that they may serue me.
\v 4 Els, if thou refuse to let my people goe, behold, to morrow will I bring the \x + \xo 10:4 \xt Wisd. 16.9.\x*locusts into thy coast.

\v 6 And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy seruants, and the houses of all the Egyptians, which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers fathers haue seene, since the day that they were vpon the earth, vnto this day. And he turned himselfe, and went out from Pharaoh.
\v 7 And Pharaohs seruants said vnto him, How long shall this man be a snare vnto vs? Let the men goe, that they may serue the \nd LORD\nd* their God: Knowest thou not yet, that Egypt is destroyed?
\v 8 And Moses and Aaron were brought againe vnto Pharaoh: and he said vnto them, Goe, serue the \nd LORD\nd* your God: \add but\add* \f + \fr 10:8 \ft Heb. who & who, &c.\f*who \add are\add* they that shall goe?
\v 9 And Moses said, We wil goe with our yong, and with our old, with our sonnes and with our daughters, with our flockes and with our heards will we goe: for we \add must hold\add* a feast vnto the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 10 And he said vnto them; Let the \nd LORD\nd* bee so with you, as I will let you goe, and your litle ones. Looke \add to it\add*, for euill \add is\add* before you.
\v 11 Not so: goe now yee \add that are\add* men, and serue the \nd LORD\nd*, for that you did desire: and they were driuen out from Pharaohs presence.
\v 12 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Moses, Stretch out thine hand ouer the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come vp vpon the land of Egypt, and eate euery herbe of the land, \add euen\add* all that the haile hath left.
\v 13 And Moses stretched forth his rod ouer the land of Egypt, and the \nd LORD\nd* brought an East wind vpon the land all that day, and all \add that\add* night: \add and\add* when it was morning, the East wind brought the locusts.
\v 14 And the locusts went vp ouer all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the coasts of Egypt: very grieuous \add were they\add*: before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall be such.
\v 15 For they couered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkned, and they did eate euery herbe of the land, and all the fruit of the trees, which the haile had left, and there remained not any greene thing in the trees, or in the herbes of the field, through all the land of Egypt.
\v 16 ¶ Then Pharaoh \f + \fr 10:16 \ft Heb. hastened to call.\f*called for Moses and Aaron in haste: and he said, I haue sinned against the \nd LORD\nd* your God, and against you.
\v 17 Now therefore forgiue, I pray thee, my sinne onely this once, and intreat the \nd LORD\nd* your God, that hee may take away from mee this death onely.
\v 18 And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 19 And the \nd LORD\nd* turned a mighty strong West wind, which tooke away the locusts, and \f + \fr 10:19 \ft Heb. fastened.\f*cast them into the red sea: there remained not one locust in all the coasts of Egypt.
\v 20 But the \nd LORD\nd* hardened Pharaohs heart, so that hee would not let the children of Israel goe.
\v 21 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Moses, Stretch out thine hand toward heauen, that there may be darkenesse ouer the land of Egypt, \f + \fr 10:21 \ft Heb. that one may feele darkenesse.\f*euen darkenes \add which\add* may be felt.
\v 22 And Moses stretched foorth his hand toward heauen: and there was a thicke darkenesse in all the land of Egypt three dayes.
\v 23 They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three dayes: \x + \xo 10:23 \xt Wisd. 18.1.\x*but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings.
\v 24 ¶ And Pharaoh called vnto Moses, and said, Goe ye, serue the \nd LORD\nd*: onely let your flockes and your herds be stayed: let your litle ones also goe with you.
\v 25 And Moses saide, Thou must giue \f + \fr 10:25 \ft Heb. into our hands.\f*vs also sacrifices, and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice vnto the \nd LORD\nd* our God.

\v 8 And all these thy seruants shall come downe vnto me, and bow downe themselues vnto me, saying, Get thee out, and all the people that \f + \fr 11:8 \ft Hebr. that is at thy feet.\f*follow thee; and after that I wil goe out: and he went out from Pharaoh in \f + \fr 11:8 \ft Heb. heat of anger.\f*a great anger.
\v 9 And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken vnto you, that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.
\v 10 And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: and the \nd LORD\nd* hardened Pharaohs heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel goe out of his land.

\iex 1 The beginning of the yeere is changed. 3 The Passeouer is instituted. 11 The Rite of the Passeouer. 15 Vnleauened bread. 29 The first borne are slaine. 31 The Israelites are driuen out of the lande. 37 They come to Succoth. 43 The ordinance of the Passeouer.
\v 1 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,
\v 2 This moneth \add shalbe\add* vnto you the beginning of moneths: it \add shall be\add* the first moneth of the yeere to you.
\v 3 ¶ Speake ye vnto all the Congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth \add day\add* of this moneth they shall take to them euery man a \f + \fr 12:3 \ft Or, kidde.\f*lambe, according to the house of \add their\add* fathers, a lambe for an house.
\v 4 And if the houshold be too little for the lambe, let him and his neighbour next vnto his house, take \add it\add* according to the number of the soules: euery man according to his eating shall make your count for the lambe.
\v 5 Your lambe shall be without blemish, a male \f + \fr 12:5 \ft Heb. sonne of a yeere.\f*of the first yeere: yee shall take \add it\add* out from the sheepe or from the goates.
\v 6 And ye shall keepe it vp vntill the fourteenth day of the same moneth: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it \f + \fr 12:6 \ft Hebr. betweene the two euenings.\f*in the euening.
\v 7 And they shall take of the blood and strike \add it\add* on the two side postes, and on the vpper doore poste, of the houses wherin they shall eate it.
\v 8 And they shall eat the flesh in that night roste with fire, and vnleauened bread, \add and\add* with bitter herbes they shall eate it.
\v 9 Eate not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roste \add with\add* fire: his head, with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.
\v 10 And ye shall let nothing of it remaine vntill the morning: and that which remaineth of it vntill the morning, ye shall burne with fire.
\v 11 ¶ And thus shall ye eate it: \add with\add* your loines girded, your shooes on your feet, and your staffe in your hand: and ye shall eate it in haste: it \add is\add* the \nd LORD\nd*s Passeouer.
\v 12 For I will passe through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the first borne in the land of Egypt, both man & beast, and against all the \f + \fr 12:12 \ft Or, princes.\f*gods of Egypt I will execute iudgement: I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 13 And the blood shall be to you for a token vpon the houses where you \add are\add*: and when I see the blood, I will passe ouer \add you\add*, and the plague shall not bee vpon you \f + \fr 12:13 \ft Heb. for a destruction.\f*to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.
\v 14 And this day shall be vnto you for a memoriall: and you shall keepe in a feast to the \nd LORD\nd*, throughout your generations: you shall keepe it a feast by an ordinance for euer.
\v 15 Seuen dayes shall ye eate vnleauened bread, euen the first day yee shall put away leauen out of your houses: For whosoeuer eateth leauened bread, from the first day vntil the seuenth day, that soule shall be cut off from Israel.
\v 16 And in the first day there shalbe an holy conuocation, and in the seuenth day \add there shall be\add* an holy conuocation to you: no maner of worke shalbe done in them, saue \add that\add* which euery \f + \fr 12:16 \ft Heb. soule.\f*man must eate, that onely may bee done of you.
\v 17 And yee shall obserue \add the feast of\add* vnleauened bread: for in this selfe same day haue I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt; therefore shall ye obserue this day in your generations, by an ordinance for euer.
\v 18 ¶ \x + \xo 12:18 \xt Leuit. 23.5. num. 28.16.\x*In the first moneth, on the fourteenth day of the moneth at euen, ye shall eate vnleauened bread vntill the one and twentieth day of the moneth at euen.
\v 19 Seuen dayes shall there bee no leauen found in your houses: for whosoeuer eateth that which is leauened, euen that soule shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or borne in the land.
\v 20 Yee shall eate nothing leauened: in all your habitations shall ye eate vnleauened bread.
\v 21 ¶ Then Moses called for all the Elders of Israel, and said vnto them; Draw out and take you a \f + \fr 12:21 \ft Or, kidde.\f*lambe, according to your families, and kill the Passeouer.
\v 22 \x + \xo 12:22 \xt Heb. 11.28.\x*And ye shall take a bunch of hysope, and dip \add it\add* in the blood that \add is\add* in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side postes with the blood that \add is\add* in the bason: and none of you shall goe out at the doore of his house, vntill the morning.
\v 23 For the \nd LORD\nd* wil passe through to smite the Egyptians: and when hee seeth the blood vpon the lintel, and on the two side-postes, the \nd LORD\nd* will passe ouer the doore, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in vnto your houses to smite \add you\add*.
\v 24 And ye shall obserue this thing for an ordinance to thee, and to thy sonnes for euer.
\v 25 And it shall come to passe when yee bee come to the land, which the \nd LORD\nd* will giue you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keepe this seruice.
\v 26 \x + \xo 12:26 \xt Iosh. 4.6.\x*And it shall come to passe, when your children shall say vnto you, What meane you by this seruice?
\v 27 That ye shall say, It \add is\add* the sacrifice of the \nd LORD\nd*s Passeouer, who passed ouer the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and deliuered our houses. And the people bowed the head, and worshipped.
\v 28 And the children of Israel went away, and did as the \nd LORD\nd* had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
\v 29 ¶ \x + \xo 12:29 \xt Chap. 11.4.\x*And it came to passe that at midnight the \nd LORD\nd* smote all the first borne in the land of Egypt, \x + \xo 12:29 \xt Wisd. 18.11.\x*from the first borne of Pharaoh that sate on his throne, vnto the first borne of the captiue that \add was\add* in the \f + \fr 12:29 \ft Heb. house of the pit.\f*dungeon, and all the first borne of cattell.
\v 30 And Pharaoh rose vp in the night, hee and all his seruants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt: for \add there was\add* not a house, where \add there was\add* not one dead.
\v 31 ¶ And hee called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Rise vp, \add and\add* get you forth from amongst my people, both you and the children of Israel: and goe, serue the \nd LORD\nd*, as ye haue said.
\v 32 Also take your flockes and your heards, as ye haue said: and bee gone, and blesse me also.
\v 33 And the Egyptians were vrgent vpon the people that they might send them out of the land in haste: for they said, We \add be\add* all dead \add men\add*.
\v 34 And the people tooke their dough before it was leauened, their \f + \fr 12:34 \ft Or, dough.\f*kneading troughes beeing bound vp in their clothes vpon their shoulders.
\v 35 And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses: and they borrowed of the Egyptians \x + \xo 12:35 \xt Chap. 3.22. and 11.2.\x*iewels of siluer, and iewels of gold, and raiment.
\v 36 And the \nd LORD\nd* gaue the people fauour in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent vnto them \add such things as they required\add*: and they spoiled the Egyptians.
\v 37 ¶ And \x + \xo 12:37 \xt Num. 33.3.\x*the children of Israel iourneyed from Rameses to Succoth, about sixe hundred thousand on foote \add that were\add* men, beside children.
\v 38 And a \f + \fr 12:38 \ft Hebr. a great mixture.\f*mixed multitude went vp also with them, and flocks and heards, \add euen\add* very much cattell.
\v 39 And they baked vnleauened cakes of the dough, which they brought forth out of Egypt; for it was not leauened: because they were thrust out of Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselues any victuall.
\v 40 ¶ Now the soiourning of the children of Israel, who dwelt in Egypt, \add was\add* \x + \xo 12:40 \xt Gen. 15.13. acts 7.6. gal. 3.17.\x*foure hundred and thirtie yeeres.
\v 41 And it came to passe at the end of the foure hundred and thirtie yeeres, euen the selfe same day it came to passe, that all the hosts of the \nd LORD\nd* went out from the land of Egypt.
\v 42 It \add is\add* a \f + \fr 12:42 \ft Hebr. a night of obseruations.\f*night to be much obserued vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: This \add is\add* that night of the \nd LORD\nd* to be obserued of all the children of Israel, in their generations.
\v 43 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* saide vnto Moses and Aaron, Th\add is\add* is the ordinance of the Passeouer: there shall no stranger eate thereof.
\v 44 But euery mans seruant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eate thereof.
\v 45 A forreiner, and an hired seruant shall not eate thereof.
\v 46 \x + \xo 12:46 \xt Numb. 9.12.\x*In one house shall it be eaten, thou shalt not carie foorth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house, \x + \xo 12:46 \xt Ioh. 19.36.\x*neither shall ye breake a bone thereof.
\v 47 All the Congregation of Israel shall \f + \fr 12:47 \ft Heb. doe it.\f*keepe it.
\v 48 And when a stranger shall soiourne with thee, and will keepe the Passeouer to the \nd LORD\nd*, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come neere, and keepe it: and he shall be as one that is borne in the land: for no vncircumcised person shall eate thereof.
\v 49 One law shall be to him that is home-borne, and vnto the stranger that soiourneth among you.
\v 50 Thus did all the children of Israel: as the \nd LORD\nd* commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
\v 51 And it came to passe the selfe same day, \add that\add* the \nd LORD\nd* did bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, by their armies.
\c 13
\iex 1 The first borne are sanctified to God. 3 The memoriall of the Passeouer is commanded. 11 The firstlings of beasts are set apart. 17 The Israelites goe out of Egypt, and cary Iosephs bones with them. 20 They come to Etham. 21 God guideth them by a pillar of a cloud, and a pillar of fire.
\v 1 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto Moses, saying,
\v 2 \x + \xo 13:2 \xt Chap. 22.29. and 34.19. leuit. 27.26. num. 3.13. & 8.16. luke 2.23.\x*Sanctifie vnto me all the first borne, whatsoeuer openeth the wombe, among the children of Israel, \add both\add* of man and of beast: it \add is\add* mine.
\v 3 ¶ And Moses said vnto the people, Remember this day, in which yee came out from Egypt, out of the house of \f + \fr 13:3 \ft Hebr. seruants.\f*bondage: for by strength of hand the \nd LORD\nd* brought you out from this \add place\add*: there shall no leauened bread be eaten.
\v 4 This day came yee out, in the moneth Abib.
\v 5 ¶ And it shalbe when the \nd LORD\nd* shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hiuites, and the Iebusites, which he sware vnto thy fathers to giue thee, a land flowing with milke and hony, that thou shalt keepe this seruice in this moneth.
\v 6 Seuen dayes thou shalt eate vnleauened bread, and in the seuenth day \add shall be\add* a feast to the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 7 Unleauened bread shall be eaten seuen dayes: and there shall no leauened bread bee seene with thee: neither shall there be leauen seene with thee in all thy quarters.
\v 8 ¶ And thou shalt shew thy sonne in that day, saying, \add This is done\add* because of that \add which\add* the \nd LORD\nd* did vnto mee, when I came forth out of Egypt.
\v 9 And it shall bee for a signe vnto thee, vpon thine hand, and for a memoriall betweene thine eyes, that the \nd LORD\nd*s law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hande hath the \nd LORD\nd* brought thee out of Egypt.
\v 10 Thou shalt therfore keepe this ordinance in his season from yeere to yere.
\v 11 ¶ And it shalbe when the \nd LORD\nd* shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites as he sware vnto thee, and to thy fathers, and shall giue it thee:
\v 12 \x + \xo 13:12 \xt Chap. 22.29. and 34.19. ezek. 44.30.\x*That thou shalt \f + \fr 13:12 \ft Heb. cause to passe ouer.\f*set apart vnto the \nd LORD\nd* all that openeth the matrix, and euery firstling that commeth of a beast, which thou hast, the males \add shall be\add* the \nd LORD\nd*s.

\v 14 ¶ And it shalbe when thy sonne asketh thee \f + \fr 13:14 \ft Hebr. to morrow.\f*in time to come, saying, What \add is\add* this? That thou shalt say vnto him; By strength of hand the \nd LORD\nd* brought vs out from Egypt, from the house of bondage.
\v 15 And it came to passe when Pharaoh would hardly let vs goe, that the \nd LORD\nd* slew all the first borne in the land of Egypt, both the first borne of man, and the first borne of beast: Therefore I sacrifice to the \nd LORD\nd* all that openeth the matrix, being males: but all the first borne of my children I redeeme.
\v 16 And it shall be for a token vpon thine hand, and for frontlets betweene thine eyes. For by strength of hand the \nd LORD\nd* brought vs foorth out of Egypt.
\v 17 ¶ And it came to passe when Pharaoh had let the people goe, that God led them not \add through\add* the way of the land of the Philistines, although that \add was\add* neere: For God saide, Lest peraduenture the people repent when they see warre, and they returne to Egypt:

\v 19 And Moses tooke the bones of Ioseph with him: for hee had straitly sworne the children of Israel, saying; \x + \xo 13:19 \xt Gene. 50.25. iosh. 24.32.\x*God will surely visite you, and ye shall cary vp my bones away hence with you.

\c 14
\iex 1 God instructeth the Israelites in their iourney. 5 Pharaoh pursueth after them. 10 The Israelites murmure. 13 Moses comforteth them. 15 God instructeth Moses. 19 The cloud remoueth behinde the campe. 21 The Israelites passe through the Red-sea, 23 which drowneth the Egyptians.
\v 1 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto Moses, saying,
\v 2 Speake vnto the children of Israel, that they turne and encampe before \x + \xo 14:2 \xt Num. 33.7.\x*Pi-hahiroth, betweene Migdol and the sea, ouer against Baal-Zephon: before it shall ye encampe by the sea.
\v 3 For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They \add are\add* intangled in the land, the wildernesse hath shut them in.
\v 4 And I will harden Pharaohs heart, that he shall follow after them, and I will be honoured vpon Pharaoh, and vpon all his hoste, That the Egyptians may know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*. And they did so.
\v 5 ¶ And it was told the King of Egypt, that the people fled: And the heart of Pharaoh and of his seruants was turned against the people, and they said, Why haue wee done this, that we haue let Israel goe from seruing vs?
\v 6 And hee made ready his charet, and tooke his people with him.
\v 7 And hee tooke sixe hundred chosen charets, and all the charets of Egypt, and captaines ouer euery one of them.
\v 8 And the \nd LORD\nd* hardened the heart of Pharaoh King of Egypt, and he pursued after the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with an high hand.
\v 9 But the \x + \xo 14:9 \xt Iosh. 24.6. 1.macc. 4.9.\x*Egyptians pursued after them (all the horses \add and\add* charets of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army) and ouertooke them encamping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth before Baal-Zephon.
\v 10 ¶ And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lift vp their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians marched after them, and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel lift vp their eyes, and beholde, the Egyptians marched after them, and they were sore afraid: and the children of Israel cried out vnto the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 11 And they said vnto Moses, Because \add there were\add* no graues in Egypt, hast thou taken vs away to die in the wildernesse? Wherefore hast thou dealt thus with vs, to cary vs foorth out of Egypt?
\v 12 \x + \xo 14:12 \xt Chap. 6.9.\x*\add Is\add* not this the word that wee did tell thee in Egypt, saying, Let vs alone, that we may serue the Egyptians? For it had bene better for vs to serue the Egyptians, then that wee should die in the wildernesse.
\v 13 ¶ And Moses saide vnto the people, Feare ye not, stand still, and see the saluation of the \nd LORD\nd*, which he will shew to you to day: \f + \fr 14:13 \ft Or, For whereas you haue seene the Egyptians to day, &c.\f*for the Egyptians whom ye haue seene to day, ye shall see them againe no more for euer.
\v 14 The \nd LORD\nd* shall fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace.
\v 15 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* saide vnto Moses, Wherefore criest thou vnto me? Speake vnto the children of Israel, that they goe forward.
\v 16 But lift thou vp thy rodde, and stretch out thine hand ouer the Sea, and diuide it: and the children of Israel shall goe on dry \add ground\add* thorow the mids of the Sea.
\v 17 And I, beholde, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get mee honour vpon Pharaoh, and vpon all his hoste, vpon his charets, and vpon his horsemen.
\v 18 And the Egyptians shall know that I \add am\add* the \nd LORD\nd*, when I haue gotten me honour vpon Pharaoh, vpon his charets, and vpon his horsemen.
\v 19 ¶ And the Angel of God which went before the campe of Israel, remoued and went behind them, and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behinde them.
\v 20 And it came betweene the campe of the Egyptians, and the campe of Israel, and it was a cloud and darkenesse \add to them\add*, but it gaue light by night \add to these\add*: so that the one came not neere the other all the night.
\v 21 And Moses stretched out his hand ouer the Sea, and the \nd LORD\nd* caused the Sea to goe backe by a strong East winde all that night, and made the Sea dry \add land\add*, and the waters were \x + \xo 14:21 \xt Iosh. 4.23. psalme 114.3.\x*diuided.

\v 23 ¶ And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them, to the midst of the Sea, \add euen\add* all Pharaohs horses, his charets and his horsemen.
\v 24 And it came to passe, that in the morning watch the \nd LORD\nd* looked vnto the hoste of the Egyptians, through the pillar of fire, and of the cloude, and troubled the hoste of the Egyptians,
\v 25 And tooke off their charet wheeles, \f + \fr 14:25 \ft Or, made them to goe heauily.\f*that they draue them heauily: So that the Egyptians said, Let vs flee from the face of Israel: for the \nd LORD\nd* fighteth for them, against the Egyptians.
\v 26 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* saide vnto Moses, Stretch out thine hand ouer the Sea, that the waters may come againe vpon the Egyptians, vpon their charets, and vpon their horsemen.
\v 27 And Moses stretched foorth his hand ouer the sea, and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared: and the Egyptians fled against it: and the \nd LORD\nd* \f + \fr 14:27 \ft Hebr. shooke off.\f*ouerthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea.
\v 28 And the waters returned, and couered the charets, and the horsemen, \add and\add* all the hoste of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them: there remained not so much as \x + \xo 14:28 \xt Psal. 106.11.\x*one of them.
\v 29 But the children of Israel walked vpon drie \add land\add*, in the midst of the sea, and the waters \add were\add* a wall vnto them on their right hand, and on their left.
\v 30 Thus the \nd LORD\nd* saued Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians: and Israel sawe the Egyptians dead vpon the sea shore.
\v 31 And Israel saw that great \f + \fr 14:31 \ft Hebr. hand.\f*worke which the \nd LORD\nd* did vpon the Egyptians: & the people feared the \nd LORD\nd*, and beleeued the \nd LORD\nd*, and his seruant Moses.

\v 6 Thy right hand, O \nd LORD\nd*, is become glorious in power, thy right hand, O \nd LORD\nd*, hath dashed in pieces the enemie.
\v 7 And in the greatnesse of thine excellencie thou hast ouerthrowen them, that rose vp against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, \add which\add* consumed them as stubble.
\v 8 And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together: the floods stood vpright as an heape, \add and\add* the depths were congealed in the heart of the Sea.
\v 9 The enemie said, I will pursue, I wil ouertake, I wil diuide the spoile: my lust shall be satisfied vpon them: I will draw my sword, mine hand shall \f + \fr 15:9 \ft Or, repossesse.\f*destroy them.

\v 1 ¶ And they tooke their iourney from Elim, and all the Congregation of the children of Israel came vnto the wildernesse of Sin, which \add is\add* betweene Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second moneth after their departing out of the land of Egypt.
\v 2 And the whole Congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wildernesse.
\v 3 And the children of Israel saide vnto them, Would to God wee had died by the hand of the \nd LORD\nd* in the land of Egypt, when wee sate by the flesh pots, \add and\add* when we did eate bread to the full: for ye haue brought vs forth into this wildernesse, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.

\v 5 And it shall come to passe, that on the sixt day, they shall prepare \add that\add* which they bring in, and it shall be twice as much as they gather dayly.
\v 6 And Moses and Aaron said vnto all the children of Israel, At euen, then ye shall know that the \nd LORD\nd* hath brought you out from the land of Egypt.
\v 7 And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the \nd LORD\nd*, for that he heareth your murmurings against the \nd LORD\nd*: And what \add are\add* wee, that yee murmure against vs?
\v 8 And Moses said, This shalbe when the \nd LORD\nd* shal giue you in the euening flesh to eate, and in the morning bread to the full: for that the \nd LORD\nd* heareth your murmurings which ye murmure against him; and what are wee? your murmurings are not against vs, but against the \nd LORD\nd*.

\v 10 And it came to passe as Aaron spake vnto the whole Congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wildernesse, and behold, the glory of the \nd LORD\nd* \x + \xo 16:10 \xt Chap. 13.21.\x*appeared in the cloude.

\v 20 Notwithstanding they hearkened not vnto Moses, but some of them left of it vntill the morning, and it bred wormes, and stanke: and Moses was wroth with them.
\v 21 And they gathered it euery morning, euery man according to his eating: and when the Sunne waxed hot, it melted.
\v 22 ¶ And it came to passe \add that\add* on the sixt day they gathered twice as much bread, two Omers for one \add man\add*: and all the rulers of the Congregation came and told Moses.

\v 24 And they laid it vp till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stinke, neither was there any worme therein.
\v 25 And Moses saide, Eate that to day, for to day \add is\add* a Sabbath vnto the \nd LORD\nd*: to day yee shall not finde it in the field.
\v 26 Sixe dayes ye shall gather it, but on the seuenth day \add which is\add* the Sabbath, in it there shall be none.
\v 27 ¶ And it came to passe, \add that\add* there went out \add some\add* of the people on the seuenth day for to gather, and they found none.
\v 28 And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Moses, How long refuse yee to keepe my Commandements, and my Lawes?
\v 29 See, for that the \nd LORD\nd* hath giuen you the Sabbath, therefore hee giueth you on the sixt day the bread of two dayes: abide yee euery man in his place: let no man goe out of his place on the seuenth day.
\v 30 So the people rested on the seuenth day.
\v 31 And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it \add was\add* like Coriander seed, white: and the taste of it \add was\add* like wafers \add made\add* with hony.

\v 33 And Moses sayd vnto Aaron, Take a pot, and put an Omer full of Manna therein, and lay it vp before the \nd LORD\nd*, to be kept for your generations.
\v 34 As the \nd LORD\nd* commaunded Moses, so Aaron layd it vp before the Testimonie, to be kept.
\v 35 And the children of Israel did eat Manna fortie yeeres, \x + \xo 16:35 \xt Iosh. 5.12. nehem. 9.15.\x*vntill they came to a land inhabited: they did eate Manna, vntill they came vnto the borders of the land of Canaan.

\iex 1 The people in the absence of Moses, cause Aaron to make a calfe. 7 God is angred thereby. 11 At the intreatie of Moses he is appeased. 15 Moses commeth downe with the Tables. 19 He breaketh them. 20 He destroyeth the calfe. 22 Aarons excuse for himselfe. 25 Moses causeth the Idolaters to bee slaine. 30 He prayeth for the people.
\v 1 ¶ And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come downe out of the mount, the people gathered themselues together vnto Aaron, and said vnto him, \x + \xo 32:1 \xt Acts. 7.40.\x*Up, make vs gods which shall goe before vs: for \add as for\add* this Moses, the man that brought vs vp out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.
\v 2 And Aaron saide vnto them, Breake off the golden earerings which \add are\add* in the eares of your wiues, of your sonnes, and of your daughters, and bring \add them\add* vnto me.
\v 3 And all the people brake off the golden earerings, which \add were\add* in their eares, and brought \add them\add* vnto Aaron.

\v 5 And when Aaron saw \add it\add*, he built an altar before it, and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow \add is\add* a feast to the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 6 And they rose vp early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings: and the \x + \xo 32:6 \xt 1.Cor. 10.7.\x*people sate downe to eate and to drinke, and rose vp to play.
\v 7 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Moses, \x + \xo 32:7 \xt Deut. 9.12.\x*Goe, get thee downe: for thy people which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, haue corrupted \add themselues\add*.

\v 9 And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Moses, \x + \xo 32:9 \xt Chap. 33.3. deut. 9.13.\x*I haue seene this people, and behold, it \add is\add* a stiffenecked people.

\v 13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel thy seruants, to whom thou swarest by thine owne selfe, and saidest vnto them, \x + \xo 32:13 \xt Gene. 12.7. and 15.7. and 48.16.\x*I will multiply your seed as the starres of heauen: and all this land that I haue spoken of, will I giue vnto your seed, and they shall inherit \add it\add* for euer.
\v 14 And the \nd LORD\nd* repented of the euill which he thought to doe vnto his people.
\v 15 ¶ And Moses turned, and went downe from the Mount, and the two Tables of the Testimony \add were\add* in his hand: the Tables \add were\add* written on both their sides; on the one side, and on the other \add were\add* they written.
\v 16 And the \x + \xo 32:16 \xt Chap. 31.18.\x*Tables \add were\add* the worke of God; and the writing \add was\add* the writing of God, grauen vpon the Tables.
\v 17 And when Ioshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, hee said vnto Moses, \add There is\add* a noise of warre in the campe.
\v 18 And he said, \add It is\add* not the voyce of \add them that\add* shout for mastery, neither \add is it\add* the voyce of \add them that\add* cry for \f + \fr 32:18 \ft Heb. weaknesse.\f*being ouercome: \add but\add* the noyse of \add them that\add* sing doe I heare.
\v 19 ¶ And it came to passe, assoone as he came nigh vnto the campe, that he saw the Calfe, and the dancing: and Moses anger waxed hot, and he cast the Tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount.
\v 20 \x + \xo 32:20 \xt Deut. 9.21.\x*And he tooke the Calfe which they had made, and burnt \add it\add* in the fire, and ground \add it\add* to powder, and strawed \add it\add* vpon the water, and made the children of Israel drinke \add of it\add*.
\v 21 And Moses said vnto Aaron, What did this people vnto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sinne vpon them?
\v 22 And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord waxe hot: thou knowest the people, that they \add are set\add* on mischiefe.
\v 23 For they said vnto me, Make vs gods which shall goe before vs: for \add as for\add* this Moses, the man that brought vs vp out of the land of Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.
\v 24 And I said vnto them, Whosoeuer hath any gold, let them breake \add it\add* off: So they gaue \add it\add* mee: then I cast it into the fire, & there came out this Calfe.
\v 25 ¶ And when Moses saw that the people \add were\add* naked, (for Aaron had made them naked vnto \add their\add* shame, amongst \f + \fr 32:25 \ft Hebr. those that rose vp against them.\f*their enemies)
\v 26 Then Moses stood in the gate of the campe, and saide, Who \add is\add* on the \nd LORD\nd*s side? \add let him come\add* vnto mee. And all the sonnes of Leui gathered themselues together vnto him.
\v 27 And hee said vnto them, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, Put euery man his sword by his side, \add and\add* go in and out from gate to gate throughout the campe, and slay euery man his brother, and euery man his companion, and euery man his neighbour.
\v 28 And the children of Leui did according to the word of Moses; and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.
\v 29 \f + \fr 32:29 \ft Or, And Moses said, Consecrate your selues to day to the \nd LORD\nd*, because euery man hath bene against his sonne, and against his brother, &c.\f*For Moses had said, \f + \fr 32:29 \ft Hebr. fill your hands.\f*Consecrate your selues to day to the \nd LORD\nd*, euen euery man vpon his sonne, and vpon his brother, that he may bestow vpon you a blessing this day.
\v 30 ¶ And it came to passe on the morrow, that Moses said vnto the people, Ye haue sinned a great sinne: And now I will goe vp vnto the \nd LORD\nd*; peraduenture I shall make an atonement for your sinne.
\v 31 And Moses returned vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, and said, Oh, this people haue sinned a great sinne, and haue made them gods of gold.
\v 32 Yet now, if thou wilt forgiue their sinne; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy Booke, which thou hast written.
\v 33 And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Moses, Whosoeuer hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my Booke.
\v 34 Therefore now goe, leade the people vnto \add the place\add* of which I haue spoken vnto thee: Behold, mine Angel shall goe before thee; Neuerthelesse in the day when I visit, I will visit their sinne vpon them.
\v 35 And the \nd LORD\nd* plagued the people, because they made the Calfe, which Aaron made.
\c 33
\iex 1 The \nd LORD\nd* refuseth to goe as he had promised with the people. 4 The people murmure thereat. 7 The Tabernacle is remoued out of the Campe. 9 The \nd LORD\nd* talketh familiarly with Moses. 12 Moses desireth to see the Glory of God.
\v 1 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Moses, Depart, \add and\add* goe vp hence, thou and the people which thou hast brought vp out of the land of Egypt, vnto the land which I sware vnto Abraham, to Isaac, & to Iacob, saying, \x + \xo 33:1 \xt Gene. 12.7.\x*Unto thy seed will I giue it.

\v 4 ¶ And when the people heard these euill tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.
\v 5 For the \nd LORD\nd* had saide vnto Moses, Say vnto the children of Israel, Ye \add are\add* a stiffenecked people: I wil come vp into the midst of thee in a moment, & consume thee: Therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to doe vnto thee.
\v 6 And the children of Israel stript themselues of their ornaments, by the mount Horeb.
\v 7 And Moses tooke the Tabernacle, & pitched it without the campe, a farre off from the campe, and called it the Tabernacle of the Congregation: And it came to passe, \add that\add* euery one which sought the \nd LORD\nd*, went out vnto the Tabernacle of the Congregation, which \add was\add* without the campe.
\v 8 And it came to passe when Moses went out vnto the Tabernacle, \add that\add* all the people rose vp, and stood euery man \add at\add* his tent doore, and looked after Moses, vntill he was gone into the Tabernacle.
\v 9 And it came to passe as Moses entred into the Tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the doore of the Tabernacle, and the \nd LORD\nd* talked with Moses.
\v 10 And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand \add at\add* the Tabernacle doore: and all the people rose vp, and worshipped euery man \add in\add* his tent doore.
\v 11 And the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh vnto his friend. And he turned againe into the campe, but his seruant Ioshua the sonne of Nun, a yong man, departed not out of the Tabernacle.
\v 12 ¶ And Moses saide vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, See, thou sayest vnto mee, Bring vp this people, and thou hast not let mee know whome thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I knowe thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight.
\v 13 Now therefore, I pray thee, If I haue found grace in thy sight, shewe mee now thy way that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation \add is\add* thy people.

\iex 1 The Tabernacle is commanded to be reared, 9 and anointed. 13 Aaron and his sonnes to be sanctified. 16 Moses performeth all things accordingly. 34 A cloude couereth the Tabernacle.
\v 1 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto Moses, saying,
\v 2 On the first day of the first moneth shalt thou set vp the Tabernacle of the Tent of the Congregation.
\v 3 And thou shalt put therein the Arke of the Testimonie, and couer the Arke with the Uaile:
\v 4 And \x + \xo 40:4 \xt Chap. 26.35.\x*thou shalt bring in the Table, and set in order \f + \fr 40:4 \ft Heb. the order thereof.\f*the things that are to be set in order vpon it, and thou shalt bring in the Candlesticke, and light the lampes thereof.
\v 5 And thou shalt set the Altar of gold for the incense before the Arke of the Testimonie, and put the hanging of the doore to the Tabernacle.
\v 6 And thou shalt set the Altar of the burnt offering, before the doore of the Tabernacle of the Tent of the Congregation.
\v 7 And thou shalt set the Lauer betweene the Tent of the Congregation and the Altar, and shalt put water therein.
\v 8 And thou shalt set vp the Court round about, and hang vp the hanging at the Court gate.
\v 9 And thou shalt take the annoynting oyle, and annoynt the Tabernacle and all that \add is\add* therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the vessels thereof: and it shalbe holy.
\v 10 Aud thou shalt annoynt the Altar of the burnt offering, and all his vessels, and sanctifie the Altar: and it shalbe an Altar \f + \fr 40:10 \ft Heb. Holines of Holinesses.\f*most Holy.
\v 11 And thou shalt annoynt the Lauer and his foot, and sanctifie it.
\v 12 And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sonnes vnto the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and wash them with water.
\v 13 And thou shalt put vpon Aaron the holy garments, and anoynt him, and sanctifie him, that he may minister vnto me in the Priests office.
\v 14 And thou shalt bring his sonnes, and clothe them with coats.
\v 15 And thou shalt anoynt them, as thou didst anoynt their father, that they may minister vnto mee in the Priests office: For their anoynting shall surely be an euerlasting Priesthood, throughout their generations.
\v 16 Thus did Moses: according to all that the \nd LORD\nd* commanded him, so did he.
\v 17 ¶ And it came to passe in the first moneth, in the second yeere, on the first \add day\add* of the moneth, \add that\add* the \x + \xo 40:17 \xt Num. 7.1.\x*Tabernacle was reared vp.
\v 18 And Moses reared vp the Tabernacle, and fastened his sockets, and set vp the boards thereof, and put in the barres thereof, and reared vp his pillars.
\v 19 And he spread abroad the tent ouer the Tabernacle, and put the couering of the Tent aboue vpon it, as the \nd LORD\nd* commanded Moses.
\v 20 ¶ And he tooke and put the testimony into the Arke, and set the staues on the Arke, and put the Mercie-seat aboue vpon the Arke.
\v 21 And he brought the Arke into the Tabernacle, and \x + \xo 40:21 \xt Chap. 35.12.\x*set vp the Uaile of the couering, and couered the Arke of the Testimony, as the \nd LORD\nd* commanded Moses.
\v 22 ¶ And hee put the Table in the Tent of the Congregation, vpon the side of the Tabernacle Northwaed, without the Uaile.
\v 23 And he set the bread in order vpon it, before the \nd LORD\nd*, as the \nd LORD\nd* had commanded Moses.
\v 24 ¶ And he put the candlesticke in the Tent of the Congregation, ouer against the Table, on the side of the Tabernacle Southward.
\v 25 And he lighted the lampes before the \nd LORD\nd*, as the \nd LORD\nd* commanded Moses.
\v 26 ¶ And he put the golden Altar in the Tent of the Congregation, before the Uaile.
\v 27 And he burnt sweet incense thereon, as the \nd LORD\nd* commanded Moses.
\v 28 ¶ And hee set vp the hanging, \add at\add* the doore of the Tabernacle.
\v 29 And he put the Altar of burnt offering \add by\add* the doore of the Tabernacle of the Tent of the Congregation, and offered vpon it the burnt offering, and the meat offring, as \x + \xo 40:29 \xt Exod. 30.9.\x*the \nd LORD\nd* commanded Moses.
\v 30 ¶ And he set the Lauer betweene the Tent of the Congregation and the Altar, & put water there, to wash withall.
\v 31 And Moses, and Aaron and his sonnes, washed their hands, and their feet thereat.
\v 32 When they went into the Tent of the Congregation, and when they came neere vnto the Altar, they washed, as the \nd LORD\nd* commanded Moses.
\v 33 And hee reared vp the Court round about the Tabernacle, and the Altar, & set vp the hanging of the Court gate: so Moses finished the worke.
\v 34 ¶ \x + \xo 40:34 \xt Numb. 9.15. 1.king. 8.10.\x*Then a cloud couered the Tent of the Congregation, and the glory of the \nd LORD\nd* filled the Tabernacle.
\v 35 And Moses was not able to enter into the Tent of the Congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the \nd LORD\nd* filled the Tabernacle.
\v 36 And when the cloud was taken vp from ouer the Tabernacle, the children of Israel \f + \fr 40:36 \ft Hebr. iourneyed.\f*went onward in all their iourneys:
\v 37 But if the cloud were not taken vp, then they iourneyed not, till the day that it was taken vp.
\v 38 For the cloud of the \nd LORD\nd* \add was\add* vpon the Tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their iourneys.
