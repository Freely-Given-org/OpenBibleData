\iex 1 The time of Ezekiels prophecie at Chebar. 4 His vision of foure Cherubims, 15 Of the foure wheeles, 26 and of the glory of God.
\v 1 ¶ Now it came to passe in the thirtieth yeere, in the fourth moneth, in the fifth \add day\add* of the moneth, (as I \add was\add* among \f + \fr 1:1 \ft Hebr. captiuitie.\f*the captiues by the riuer of Chebar) \add that\add* the heauens were opened, and I saw visions of God.
\v 2 In the fifth \add day\add* of the moneth, (which \add was\add* the fifth yeere of king Iehoiakins captiuitie,)
\v 3 The word of the \nd LORD\nd* came expresly vnto \f + \fr 1:3 \ft Hebr. Iehezkel.\f*Ezekiel the Priest, the sonne of Buzi, in the land of the Caldeans, by the riuer Chebar, and the hand of the \nd LORD\nd* was there vpon him.
\v 4 ¶ And I looked, and behold, a whirlewinde came out of the North, a great cloude, and a fire \f + \fr 1:4 \ft Heb catching it selfe.\f*infoulding it selfe, and a brightnesse \add was\add* about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.
\v 5 Also out of the midst thereof \add came\add* the likenesse of foure liuing creatures, and this \add was\add* their appearance: they had the likenesse of a man.
\v 6 And euery one had foure faces, and euery one had foure wings.
\v 7 And their feet \add were\add* \f + \fr 1:7 \ft Hebr. a straight foot.\f*straight feet, and the sole of their feet \add was\add* like the sole of a calues foot, and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brasse.
\v 8 And \add they had\add* the handes of a man vnder their wings on their foure sides, and they foure had their faces and their wings.
\v 9 Their wings \add were\add* ioyned one to another, they turned not when they went: they went euery one straight forward.
\v 10 As for the likenesse of their faces, they foure had the face of a man, and the face of a lyon on the right side, and they foure had the face of an oxe on the left side: they foure also had the face of an eagle.
\v 11 Thus \add were\add* their faces: and their wings \add were\add* \f + \fr 1:11 \ft Or, diuided aboue.\f*stretched vpward, two \add wings\add* of euery one \add were\add* ioyned one to an other, and two couered their bodies.
\v 12 And they went euery one straight forward: whither the spirit was to goe, they went: \add and\add* they turned not when they went.
\v 13 As for the likenesse of the liuing creatures, their appearance \add was\add* like burning coles of fire, \add and\add* like the appearance of lamps: it went vp and downe among the liuing creatures, and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went foorth lightning.
\v 14 And the liuing creatures ranne, and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.
\v 15 ¶ Now as I behelde the liuing creatures: behold one wheele vpon the earth by the liuing creatures, with his foure faces.
\v 16 The appearance of the wheeles, and their worke \add was\add* like vnto the colour of a Berill: and they foure had one likenesse, and their appearance and their worke \add was\add* as it were a wheele in the middle of a wheele.
\v 17 When they went, they went vpon their foure sides: \add and\add* they returned not when they went.
\v 18 As for their rings, they were so high, that they were dreadful, and their \f + \fr 1:18 \ft Or, strakes.\f*rings \add were\add* full of eyes round about them foure.
\v 19 And when the liuing creatures went, the wheeles went by them: and when the liuing creatures were lift vp from the earth, the wheels were lift vp.
\v 20 Whithersoeuer the spirit was to goe, they went, thither \add was their\add* spirit to goe, and the wheeles were lifted vp ouer against them: for the spirit \f + \fr 1:20 \ft Or, of life.\f*of the liuing creature \add was\add* in the wheeles.
\v 21 When those went, \add these\add* went, and when those stood, \add these\add* stood; and when those were lifted vp from the earth, the wheeles were lifted vp ouer against them: for the spirit \f + \fr 1:21 \ft Or, of life.\f*of the liuing creature \add was\add* in the wheeles.
\v 22 And the likenesse of the firmament vpon the heads of the liuing creature \add was\add* as the colour of the terrible chrystall, stretched foorth ouer their heads aboue.
\v 23 And vnder the firmament \add were\add* their wings straight, the one toward the other, euery one had two which couered on this side, & euery one had two, which couered on that side their bodies.
\v 24 And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almightie, the voice of speech, as the noise of an hoste: when they stood, they let downe their wings.
\v 25 And there was a voice from the firmament, that \add was\add* ouer their heads, when they stood, \add and\add* had let downe their wings.
\v 26 ¶ And aboue the firmament that \add was\add* ouer their heads, \add was\add* the likenesse of a Throne, as the appearance of a Saphyre stone, and vpon the likenesse of the Throne \add was\add* the likenesse as the appearance of a man aboue vpon it.
\v 27 And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it: from the appearance of his loynes euen vpward, and from the appearance of his loynes euen downeward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, & it had brightnesse round about.
\v 28 As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloude in the day of raine, so \add was\add* the appearance of the brightnesse round about. This \add was\add* the appearance of the likenesse of the glory of the \nd LORD\nd*: and when I saw \add it\add*, I fell vpon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.

\iex 1 Ezekiels commission: 6 His instruction. 9 The roule of his heauie prophecie.
\v 1 ¶ And he said vnto me, Son of man, stand vpon thy feete, and I will speake vnto thee.
\v 2 And the spirit entred into me, when hee spake vnto me, and set me vpon my feete, that I heard him that spake vnto me:
\v 3 And hee said vnto me, Sonne of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious \f + \fr 2:3 \ft Heb. nations.\f*nation that hath rebelled against mee: they and their fathers haue transgressed against mee, \add euen\add* vnto this very day.
\v 4 For \add they are\add* \f + \fr 2:4 \ft Heb. hard of face.\f*impudent children and stiffe hearted: I doe send thee vnto them, and thou shalt say vnto them, Thus sayth the \nd LORD\nd* God.
\v 5 And they, whether they wil heare or whether they will forbeare, (for they \add are\add* a rebellious house) yet shall know that there hath bene a Prophet among them.
\v 6 ¶ And thou sonne of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their wordes, though \f + \fr 2:6 \ft Or, rebels.\f*bryars and thornes \add be\add* with thee, and thou doest dwell among scorpions: \add be\add* not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their lookes, though they be a rebellious house.
\v 7 And thou shalt speake my words vnto them, whether they will heare or whether they will forbeare, for they \add are\add* most \f + \fr 2:7 \ft Heb. rebellion.\f*rebellious.
\v 8 But thou, sonne of man, heare what I say vnto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth and \x + \xo 2:8 \xt Reu.10.9.\x*eate that I giue thee.
\v 9 ¶ And when I looked, behold, an hand \add was\add* sent vnto mee, and loe, a roule of a booke \add was\add* therein.
\v 10 And he spread it before me, and it \add was\add* written within and without, and \add there was\add* written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.

\iex 1 Ezekiel eateth the roule. 4 God encourageth him. 15 God sheweth him the rule of prophecie. 22 God shutteth and openeth the Prophets mouth.
\v 1 ¶ Moreouer he said vnto me, Sonne of man, eate that thou findest: eate this roule, and goe, speake vnto the house of Israel.
\v 2 So I opened my mouth, and hee caused me to eate that roule.
\v 3 \x + \xo 3:3 \xt Reu. 10.9.\x*And he said vuto mee; Sonne of man, cause thy belly to eate, and fill thy bowels with this roule that I giue thee. Then did I eate \add it\add*, and it was in my mouth as honie for sweetnesse.
\v 4 ¶ And he said vnto me, Sonne of man, goe, get thee vnto the house of Israel, and speake with my words vnto them.
\v 5 \f + \fr 3:5 \ft Heb. deepe of lippes and heauie of tongue, and so ver. 6.\f*For thou \add art\add* not sent to a people of a strange speech, and of an hard language, \add but\add* to the house of Israel.
\v 6 \f + \fr 3:6 \ft Heb. deepe of lip, and heauie language.\f*\f + \fr 3:6 \ft Or, if I had sent thee &c. would they not haue hearkened vnto thee?\f*Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not vnderstand: surely had I sent thee to them, they would haue hearkened vnto thee:
\v 7 \f + \fr 3:7 \ft Heb. stiffe of forhead and hard of heart.\f*But the house of Israel will not hearken vnto thee; for they will not hearken vnto me: for all the house of Israel \add are\add* impudent and hard hearted.
\v 8 Behold, I haue made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.
\v 9 \x + \xo 3:9 \xt Ier.1.8.\x*As an adamant harder then flint haue I made thy forehead: feare them not, neither be dismayed at their lookes, though they \add be\add* a rebellious house.
\v 10 Moreouer he said vnto me, Sonne of man, all my words that I shall speake vnto thee, receiue in thine heart, and heare with thine eares.
\v 11 And goe, get thee to them of the captiuity, vnto thy people, and speake vnto them and tell them, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* God, whether they will heare, or whether they will forbeare.
\v 12 Then the spirit tooke me vp, and I heard behind me a voyce of a great rushing, \add saying\add* Blessed \add be\add* the glory of the \nd LORD\nd* from his place.
\v 13 \f + \fr 3:13 \ft Heb. kissed.\f*\add I heard\add* also the noise of the wings of the liuing creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheeles ouer against them, and a noise of a great rushing.
\v 14 \f + \fr 3:14 \ft Heb. bitter.\f*\f + \fr 3:14 \ft Heb. hot anger.\f*So the spirit lifted me vp, and tooke me away, and I went in bitternesse, in the heate of my spirit, but the hand of the \nd LORD\nd* was strong vpon mee.
\v 15 ¶ Then I came to them of the captiuity at Tel-abib, that dwelt by the riuer of Chebar, and I sate where they sate, and remained there astonished among them seuen daies.
\v 16 And it came to passe at the end of seuen dayes, that the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came vnto me, saying;
\v 17 \x + \xo 3:17 \xt Chap.33.7\x*Sonne of man, I haue made thee a watchman vnto the house of Israel: therefore heare the word at my mouth, & giue them warning from me.
\v 18 When I say vnto the wicked; Thou shalt surely die, and thou giuest him not warning, nor speakest to warne the wicked from his wicked way to saue his life; the same wicked \add man\add* shall die in his iniquitie: but his blood will I require at thine hand.
\v 19 Yet if thou warne the wicked, and he turne not from his wickednesse, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity, but thou hast deliuered thy soule.
\v 20 \x + \xo 3:20 \xt Chap. 18.24.\x*\f + \fr 3:20 \ft Heb. righteousnesses.\f*Againe, when a righteous \add man\add* doth turne from his righteousnesse and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling blocke before him, he shall die: because thou hast not giuen him warning, he shall die in his sinne, and his righteousnesse which he hath done shal not be remembred: but his blood will I require at thine hand.
\v 21 Neuerthelesse if thou warne the righteous \add man\add*, that the righteous sinne not, and he doth not sinne; he shall surely liue, because he is warned: also thou hast deliuered thy soule.
\v 22 ¶ And the hand of the \nd LORD\nd* was there vpon me, and he said vnto me; Arise, goe forth into the plaine, and I will there talke with thee.
\v 23 \f + \fr 3:23 \ft Chap. 1.\f*Then I arose and went forth into the plaine, and behold, the glory of the \nd LORD\nd* stood there as the glory which I saw by the riuer of Chebar, and I fell on my face.
\v 24 Then the spirit entred into me, and set me vpon my feet, and spake with me, and said vnto me, Goe shut thy selfe within thine house.
\v 25 But thou, O sonne of man, behold, they shall put bands vpon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not goe out among them.
\v 26 \f + \fr 3:26 \ft A man reprouing.\f*And I will make thy tongue cleaue to the roofe of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumme and shalt not be to them a reprouer: for they \add are\add* a rebellious house.
\v 27 But when I speake with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say vnto them; Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* God, He that heareth, let him heare, and he that forbeareth, let him forbeare: for they \add are\add* a rebellious house.

\v 4 Lie thou also vpon thy left side, and lay the iniquitie of the house of Israel vpon it: \add according\add* to the number of the dayes that thou shalt lie vpon it, thou shalt beare their iniquitie.
\v 5 \x + \xo 4:5 \xt Num.14.34.\x*For I haue layed vpon thee the yeeres of their iniquitie, according to the number of the dayes, three hundreth and ninetie daies. So shalt thou beare the iniquitie of the house of Israel.
\v 6 \f + \fr 4:6 \ft Hebr. a day for a yeere, a day for a yeere.\f*And when thou hast accomplished them, lie againe on thy right side, and thou shalt beare the iniquitie of the house of Iudah fourtie dayes: I haue appointed thee each day for a yeere.
\v 7 Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Ierusalem, and thine arme \add shalbe\add* vncouered, and thou shalt prophecie against it.

\v 13 And the \nd LORD\nd* said, Euen thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, whither I will driue them.
\v 14 Then said I, Ah \nd LORD\nd* God, behold, my soule hath not bene polluted: for from my youth vp euen til now, haue I not eaten of that which dieth of it selfe, or is torne in pieces, neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.
\v 15 Then he said vnto me, Loe, I haue giuen thee cowes doung for mans doung and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith.

\v 6 And she hath changed my iudgements into wickednesse more then the nations, and my statutes more then the countreyes that \add are\add* round about her: for they haue refused my iudgements and my statutes, they haue not walked in them.
\v 7 Therefore thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* God, Because yee multiplied more then the nations that \add are\add* round about you, \add and\add* haue not walked in my Statutes, neither haue kept my iudgments, neither haue done according to the iudgements of the nations that \add are\add* round about you:

\v 5 And Aholah played the harlot, when she was mine, & she doted on her louers, on the Assyrians \add her\add* neighbors,

\v 13 Then I saw that she was defiled, \add that\add* they tooke both one way;
\v 14 And \add that\add* she increased her whoredomes: for when shee saw men pourtrayed vpon the wall, the images of the Caldeans pourtrayed with vermilion,

\v 18 So shee discouered her whoredomes, and discouered her nakednesse; then my mind was alienated from her, like as my minde was alienated from her sister.
\v 19 Yet shee multiplied her whoredomes, in calling to remembrance the dayes of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.
\v 20 For she doted vpon their paramours, whose flesh \add is as\add* the flesh of asses, and whose issue \add is like\add* the issue of horses.
\v 21 Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdnesse of thy youth, in bruising thy teates by the Egyptians, for the paps of thy youth.

\v 29 And they shall deale with thee hatefully, and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leaue thee naked and bare, and the nakednesse of thy whoredomes shall bee discouered, both thy lewdnesse and thy whoredomes.

\v 4 So he measured the length therof twentie cubites, and the bredth twentie cubites before the temple, and he said vnto me; This \add is\add* the most holy \add place\add*.
\v 5 After he measured the wall of the house sixe cubites, and the bredth of euerie side-chamber foure cubites round about the house on \add euery\add* side.
