\iex 1 The time, 3 and the calling of Ieremiah: 11 His propheticall visions of an Almond rod, and a seething pot: 15 His heauy message against Iudah. 17 God incourageth him with his promise of assistance.
\v 1 ¶ The wordes of Ieremiah the sonne of Hilkiah, of the Priests that \add were\add* in Anathoth in the land of Beniamin:
\v 2 To whom the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came in the dayes of Iosiah the sonne of Amon king of Iudah, in the thirteenth yeere of his reigne.
\v 3 It came also in the dayes of Iehoiakim the sonne of Iosiah king of Iudah, vnto the ende of the eleuenth yeere of Zedekiah the sonne of Iosiah king of Iudah, vnto the carrying away of Ierusalem captiue in the fift moneth.
\v 4 Then the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came vnto me, saying,
\v 5 Before I \x + \xo 1:5 \xt Isa.49.1,5.\x*formed thee in the bellie, I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the wombe, I \x + \xo 1:5 \xt Gal. 5.1, 15.\x*sanctified thee, \add and\add* I \f + \fr 1:5 \ft Hebr. gaue.\f*ordeined thee a Prophet vnto the nations.
\v 6 Then said I, Ah \x + \xo 1:6 \xt Exo.3.4.\x*\nd LORD\nd* God, behold, I cannot speake, for I \add am\add* a childe.
\v 7 ¶ But the \nd LORD\nd* sayd vnto me, Say not, I \add am\add* a childe: for thou shalt goe to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoeuer I command thee, thou shalt speake.
\v 8 \x + \xo 1:8 \xt Eze.3.9.\x*Be not afraid of their faces: for \x + \xo 1:8 \xt Exo.3.12. deu.31.6,8. iosh.1.5. heb.13.6.\x*I \add am\add* with thee to deliuer thee, sayth the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 9 Then the \nd LORD\nd* put foorth his hand, and \x + \xo 1:9 \xt Isai.6.7.\x*touched my mouth, and the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto me, Behold, I haue \x + \xo 1:9 \xt Cha.5.14.\x*put my words in thy mouth.
\v 10 See, I haue this day set thee ouer the nations, and ouer the kingdomes, to \x + \xo 1:10 \xt Cha.18.7. 2.cor.10.4,5.\x*roote out, and to pull downe, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build and to plant.
\v 11 ¶ Moreouer, the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came vnto me, saying; Ieremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rodde of an almond tree.
\v 12 Then said the \nd LORD\nd* vnto me, Thou hast well seene: for I will hasten my word to performe it.
\v 13 And the worde of the \nd LORD\nd* came vnto mee the second time, saying; What seest thou? And I said; I see a seething pot, and the face thereof was \f + \fr 1:13 \ft Heb. from the face of the North.\f*towards the North.
\v 14 Then the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto me; Out of the \x + \xo 1:14 \xt Chap. 4.6.\x*North an euill \f + \fr 1:14 \ft Heb. shall be opened.\f*shal breake foorth vpon all the inhabitants of the land.
\v 15 For loe, I will \x + \xo 1:15 \xt Cha.5.15. and 6.22. and 10.22.\x*call all the families of the kingdoms of the North, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, and they shall come, and they shall set euery one his throne at the entring of the gates of Ierusalem, and against all the walles thereof round about, & against all the cities of Iudah.
\v 16 And I will vtter my iudgements against them touching all their wickednesse, who haue forsaken me, and haue burnt incense vnto other gods, and worshipped the workes of their owne hands.
\v 17 ¶ Thou therefore gird vp thy loynes, and arise and speake vnto them all that I commaund thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I \f + \fr 1:17 \ft Or, breake to pieces.\f*confound thee before them.
\v 18 For behold, I haue made thee this day \x + \xo 1:18 \xt Cha.6.27. and 15.20. isai. 50.7.\x*a defenced citie, and an yron pillar, and brasen walles against the whole land, against the kings of Iudah, against the princes thereof, against the Priests thereof, and against the people of the land.
\v 19 And they shall fight against thee, but they shall not preuaile against thee: for I \add am\add* with thee, sayth the \nd LORD\nd*, to deliuer thee.

\v 1 ¶ Moreouer, the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came to me, saying;
\v 2 Goe, and crie in the eares of Ierusalem, saying; Thus sayth the \nd LORD\nd*, I remember \f + \fr 2:2 \ft Or, for thy sake.\f*thee, the kindnesse of thy \x + \xo 2:2 \xt Eze.16.8. cha. 12.14.\x*youth, the loue of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wildernesse, in a land \add that was\add* not sowen.
\v 3 Israel \add was\add* holinesse vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, \add and\add* the first fruites of his increase: all that deuoure him, shall offend, euill shall come vpon them, sayth the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 4 Heare ye the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, O house of Iacob, and all the families of the house of Israel.

\v 7 And I brought you into a plentifull countrey, to eate the fruit thereof, and the goodnesse thereof; but when ye entred yee \x + \xo 2:7 \xt Psal.78.58. and 106.38.\x*defiled my land, and made mine heritage an abomination.
\v 8 The Priests said not, Where \add is\add* the \nd LORD\nd*? and they that handle the \x + \xo 2:8 \xt Rom.2.20\x*Law knew me not: the pastours also transgressed against mee, and the Prophets prophecied by Baal, and walked after \add things that\add* doe not profit.

\iex 1 Hananiah prophecieth falsely the returne of the vessels and of Ieconiah. 5 Ieremiah wishing it to be true, sheweth that the euent will declare who are true Prophets. 10 Hananiah breaketh Ieremiahs yoke. 12 Ieremiah telleth of an yron yoke, 15 and foretelleth Hananiahs death.

\v 7 Neuerthelesse, heare thou now this word that I speake in thine eares, and in the eares of all the people.

\v 12 ¶ Then the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came vnto Ieremiah the Prophet (after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the necke of the Prophet Ieremiah) saying,

\v 14 For thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel, I haue put a yoke of yron vpon the neck of all these nations, that they may serue Nebuchad-nezzar king of Babylon, and they shall serue him, and I haue giuen him the beasts of the field also.
\v 15 ¶ Then said the Prophet Ieremiah vnto Hananiah the prophet, Heare nowe Hananiah: the \nd LORD\nd* hath not sent thee, but thou makest this people to trust in a lye.

\iex 1 Ieremiah being imprisoned by Zedekiah for his prophecie, 6 buyeth Hanameels field. 13 Baruch must preserue the euidences, as tokens of the peoples returne. 16 Ieremiah in his prayer complaineth to God. 26 God confirmeth the captiuitie for their sinnes, 36 and promiseth a gracious returne.
\v 1 ¶ The worde that came to Ieremiah from the \nd LORD\nd* in the tenth yeere of Zedekiah king of Iudah, which \add was\add* the eighteenth yeere of Nebuchad-rezzar.

\v 2 Goe vnto the house of the Rechabites, and speake vnto them, and bring them into the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, into one of the chambers, and giue them wine to drinke.
\v 3 Then I tooke Iaazaniah the sonne of Ieremiah the sonne of Habazimah and his brethren, and all his sonnes, and the whole house of the Rechabites.
\v 4 \f + \fr 35:4 \ft Hebr. threshold or vessell.\f*And I brought them into the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, into the chamber of the sonnes of Hanan, the sonne of Igdaliah a man of God, which \add was\add* by the chamber of the Princes, which \add was\add* aboue the chamber of Maaseiah, the sonne of Shallum, the keeper of the doore.
\v 5 And I set before the sonnes of the house of the Rechabites, pottes, full of wine, and cups, and I said vnto them, Drinke ye wine.
\v 6 But they said, We will drinke no wine: for Ionadab the sonne of Rechab our father, commanded vs, saying; Ye shall drinke no wine, \add neither ye\add*, nor your sonnes for euer.
\v 7 Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant Uineyard, nor haue \add any\add*: but all your dayes ye shall dwell in tents, that ye may liue many dayes in the land where ye \add be\add* strangers.
\v 8 Thus haue we obeyed the voice of Ionadab the sonne of Rechab our father, in all that he hath charged vs, to drinke no wine all our dayes, we, our wiues, our sonnes, nor our daughters:
\v 9 Nor to build houses for vs to dwel in, neither haue we Uineyard, nor field, nor seed.
\v 10 But wee haue dwelt in tents, and haue obeyed, and done according to all that Ionadab our father commanded vs.
\v 11 But it came to passe when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came vp into the land, that we said, Come, and let vs goe to Ierusalem for feare of the armie of the Caldeans, and for feare of the armie of the Syrians: so we dwell at Ierusalem.
\v 12 ¶ Then came the word of the \nd LORD\nd* vnto Ieremiah, saying,
\v 13 Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel, Goe and tel the men of Iudah, and inhabitants of Ierusalem, Will yee not receiue instruction to hearken to my words, saith the \nd LORD\nd*?
\v 14 The wordes of Ionadab the sonne of Rechab, that hee commanded his sonnes, not to drinke wine, are performed; for vnto this day they drinke none, but obey their fathers commandement: notwithstanding I haue spoken vnto you, rising early, and speaking, but ye hearkened not vnto me.
\v 15 \x + \xo 35:15 \xt Chap. 18.11. and 25.5.\x*I haue sent also vnto you all my seruants the Prophets, rising vp early and sending \add them\add*, saying, Returne ye now euery man from his euil way, and amend your doings, and goe not after other gods to serue them, and ye shall dwell in the land, which I haue giuen to you, and to your fathers: but yee haue not enclined your eare, nor hearkned vnto me.
\v 16 Because the sonnes of Ionadab, the sonne of Rechab, haue performed the commaundement of their father, which he commaunded them, but this people hath not hearkened vnto me;
\v 17 Therefore thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* God of hostes, the God of Israel, Behold, I will bring vpon Iudah, and vpon all the inhabitants of Ierusalem, all the euill that I haue pronounced against them: because I haue spoken vnto them, but they haue not heard, and I haue called vnto them, but they haue not answered.
\v 18 ¶ And Ieremiah sayd vnto the house of the Rechabites, Thus sayth the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts the God of Israel, Because ye haue obeyed the commandement of Ionadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according vnto all that he hath commanded you:
\v 19 \f + \fr 35:19 \ft Heb. there shall not a man be cut off from, &c.\f*Therefore thus sayth the \nd LORD\nd* of hostes, the God of Israel, Ionadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for euer.

\iex 1 Ieremiah causeth Baruch to write his prophecie, 5 and publikely ro reade it. 11 The Princes hauing intelligence thereof by Michaiah, send Iehudi to fetch the roule and reade it. 19 They will Baruch to hide himselfe and Ieremiah. 20 The king Iehoiakim being certified thereof, heareth part of it, and burneth the roule. 27 Ieremiah denounceth his iudgement. 32 Baruch writeth a newe copie.
\v 1 ¶ And it came to passe in the fourth yeere of Iehoiakim the sonne of Iosiah king of Iudah, \add that\add* this word came vnto Ieremiah from the \nd LORD\nd*, saying;
\v 2 \x + \xo 36:2 \xt Cha.25.3\x*Take thee a roule of a booke, and write therein all the words that I haue spoken vnto thee against Israel, and against Iudah, & against all the nations, from the day I spake vnto thee, frō the dayes of Iosiah, euen vnto this day.
\v 3 It may be that the house of Iudah will heare all the euil which I purpose to doe vnto them; that they may returne euery man from his euill way, that I may forgiue their iniquitie, and their sinne.
\v 4 Then Ieremiah called Baruch the sonne of Neriah, and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Ieremiah all the words of the \nd LORD\nd*, which he had spoken vnto him, vpon a roule of a booke.
\v 5 And Ieremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I \add am\add* shut vp, I cannot goe into the house of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 6 Therefore goe thou and reade in the roule, which thou hast written from my mouth, the wordes of the \nd LORD\nd* in the eares of the people in the \nd LORD\nd*s house vpon the fasting day: and also thou shalt reade them in the eares of all Iudah, that come out of their cities.
\v 7 \f + \fr 36:7 \ft Heb. their supplication shall fall.\f*It may bee they will present their supplication before the \nd LORD\nd*, and will returne euery one from his euill way; for great \add is\add* the anger and the furie that the \nd LORD\nd* hath pronounced against this people.
\v 8 And Baruch the sonne of Neriah did according to all that Ieremiah the Prophet commanded him, reading in the booke the wordes of the \nd LORD\nd*, in the \nd LORD\nd*s house.
\v 9 And it came to passe in the fifth yeere of Iehoiakim the sonne of Iosiah king of Iudah, in the ninth moneth, \add that\add* they proclaimed a fast before the \nd LORD\nd* to all the people in Ierusalem, & to all the people that came from the cities of Iudah vnto Ierusalem.
\v 10 \f + \fr 36:10 \ft Or, doore.\f*\x + \xo 36:10 \xt Chap. 26.10.\x*Then read Baruch in the booke, the wordes of Ieremiah in the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, in the chamber of Gemariah the sonne of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court at the entry of the newe gate of the \nd LORD\nd*s house, in the eares of all the people.
\v 11 ¶ When Michaiah the sonne of Gemariah the sonne of Shaphan had heard out of the booke, all the words of the \nd LORD\nd*;
\v 12 Then hee went downe into the kings house into the scribes chamber, and loe, all the princes sate there, \add euen\add* Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the sonne of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the sonne of Achbor, and Gemariah the sonne of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the sonne of Hananiah, and all the princes.
\v 13 Then Michaiah declared vnto them all the words that hee had heard when Baruch read the booke in the eares of the people.
\v 14 Therefore all the princes sent Iehudi the sonne of Nethaniah, the sonne of Shelemiah, the sonne of Cushi, vnto Baruch, saying; Take in thine hand the roule wherein thou hast read in the eares of the people, and come. So Baruch the sonne of Neriah took the roule in his hand, and came vnto them.
\v 15 And they sayde vnto him, Sit downe now and read it in our eares. So Baruch read \add it\add* in their eares.
\v 16 Now it came to passe when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and sayd vnto Baruch, Wee will surely tell the King of all these words.
\v 17 And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell vs now, How diddest thou write all these words at his mouth?
\v 18 Then Baruch answered them, Hee pronounced all these words vnto me with his mouth, and I wrote \add them\add* with inke in the Booke.
\v 19 Then said the Princes vnto Baruch, Go hide thee, thou and Ieremiah, and let no man know where yee bee.
\v 20 ¶ And they went in to the King into the Court, bnt they layed vp the roule in the chamber of Elishama the Scribe, and told all the words in the eares of the king.
\v 21 So the king sent Iehudi to fet the roule, and hee tooke it out of Elishama the scribes chamber, and Iehudi read it in the eares of the king, and in the eares of all the princes which stood beside the king.
\v 22 Now the king sate in the winter house, in the ninth moneth, & \add there was a fire\add* on the hearth burning before him.
\v 23 And it came to passe \add that\add* when Iehudi had read three or foure leaues, he cut \add it\add* with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that \add was\add* on the hearth, vntill all the roule \add was\add* consumed in the fire that was on the hearth.
\v 24 Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, \add neither\add* the king, nor any of his seruants that heard all these words.
\v 25 Neuerthelesse Elnathan, and Delaiah & Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burne the roule, but he would not heare them.
\v 26 \f + \fr 36:26 \ft Or, of the king.\f*But the king commaunded Ierahmeel the sonne of Hammelech, and Seraiah the sonne of Azriel, & Shelennah the sonne of Abdiel, to take Baruch the scribe, and Ieremiah the Prophet: but the \nd LORD\nd* hid them.
\v 27 ¶ Then the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came to Ieremiah (after that the king had burnt the roule and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Ieremiah) saying;
\v 28 Take thee againe another roule, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roule, which Iehoiakim the king of Iudah hath burnt.
\v 29 And thou shalt say to Iehoiakim king of Iudah, Thus sayth the \nd LORD\nd*, Thou hast burnt this roule, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainely come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?
\v 30 \x + \xo 36:30 \xt Chap.22.19.\x*Therefore thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of Iehoiakim king of Iudah; He shall haue none to sit vpon the throne of Dauid, and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heate, and in the night to the frost.

\v 32 ¶ \f + \fr 36:32 \ft Heb. as they.\f*Then tooke Ieremiah another roule, and gaue it to Baruch the scribe the sonne of Neriah, who wrote therein from the mouth of Ieremiah, all the words of the booke which Iehoiakim king of Iudah had burnt in the fire, and there were added besides vnto them, many like words.

\iex 1 The Egyptians hauing raised the siege of the Caldeans, king Zedekiah sendeth to Ieremiah to pray for the people. 6 Ieremiah prophesieth the Caldeans certaine returne and victory. 11 He is taken for a fugitiue, beaten and put in prison. 16 He assureth Zedekiah of the captiuitie. 18 Intreating for his liberty, he obtaineth some fauour.
\v 1 ¶ \x + \xo 37:1 \xt Chap.22.24. 2.kings 24.17. and 2.chron. 36 10.\x*And king Zedekiah the sonne of Iosiah reigned in stead of Coniah the son of Iehoiakim, whō Nebuchad-rezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Iudah.
\v 2 \f + \fr 37:2 \ft Heb. by the hand of the prophet.\f*But neither he, nor his seruants, nor the people of the land, did hearken vnto the words of the \nd LORD\nd*, which he spake by the prophet Ieremiah.
\v 3 And Zedekiah the king sent Iehucal the sonne of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Ieremiah, saying, Pray now vnto the \nd LORD\nd* our God for vs.
\v 4 Nowe Ieremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him into prison.
\v 5 Then Pharaohs armie was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Caldeans that besieged Ierusalem, heard tidings of them, they departed from Ierusalem.
\v 6 ¶ Then came the word of the \nd LORD\nd* vnto the Prophet Ieremiah, saying,
\v 7 Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, the God of Israel, Thus shall ye say to the king of Iudah, that sent you vnto me to enquire of me, Behold, Pharaohs armie which is come forth to helpe you, shall returne to Egypt into their owne land.
\v 8 And the Caldeans shall come againe, and fight against this citie and take it, and burne it with fire.
\v 9 \f + \fr 37:9 \ft Heb. soules\f*Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Deceiue not your selues, saying, The Caldeans shall surely depart from vs: for they shall not depart.

\v 11 ¶ \f + \fr 37:11 \ft Heb. made to ascend.\f*And it came to passe that when the armie of the Caldeans was broken vp from Ierusalem for feare of Pharaohs armie,
\v 12 \f + \fr 37:12 \ft Or, to slip away from thence in the midst of the people.\f*Then Ieremiah went forth out of Ierusalem to goe into the lande of Beniamin, to separate himselfe thence in the mids of the people.
\v 13 And when he was in the gate of Beniamin, a captaine of the warde \add was\add* there, whose name \add was\add* Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the sonne of Hananiah, & he tooke Ieremiah the Prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the Caldeans
\v 14 \f + \fr 37:14 \ft Heb. falsehood or lie.\f*Then said Ieremiah, \add It is\add* false, I fall not away to the Caldeans: but he hearkened not to him: so Irijah tooke Ieremiah, and brought him to the princes.
\v 15 Wherfore the princes were wroth with Ieremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison, in the house of Ionathan the scribe, for they had made that the prison.
\v 16 ¶ \f + \fr 37:16 \ft Or, Celles.\f*When Ieremiah was entred into the dungeon, and into the cabbins, and Ieremiah had remained there many dayes:
\v 17 Then Zedekiah the king sent and tooke him out, and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there \add any\add* word from the \nd LORD\nd*? and Ieremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be deliuered into the hand of the king of Babylon.
\v 18 Moreouer Ieremiah sayd vnto king Zedekiah, What haue I offended against thee, or against thy seruants, or against this people, that yee haue put me in prison?
\v 19 Where \add are\add* now your prophets, which prophecied vnto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?
\v 20 \f + \fr 37:20 \ft Heb. let my supplication fall.\f*Therefore heare now, I pray thee, O my \nd LORD\nd* the king; let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee, that thou cause me not to returne to the house of Ionathan the scribe, lest I die there.
\v 21 Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Ieremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should giue him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers streete, vntill all the bread in the citie were spent. Thus Ieremiah remained in the court of the prison.
\c 38
\iex 1 Ieremiah by a false suggestion is put into the dungeon of Malchiah. 7 Ebed-melech, by suite, getteth him some inlargement. 14 Vpon secret conference, he counsaileth the king by yeelding to saue his life. 24 By the kings instructions, he concealeth the conference from the Princes.
\v 1 ¶ Then Shephatiah the sonne of Mattan, and Gedaliah the sonne of Pashur and Iucal the sonne of Shelemiah, & Pashur the sonne of Malchiah heard the words that Ieremiah had spoken vnto all the people, saying,
\v 2 \x + \xo 38:2 \xt Cha.21.9\x*Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, He that remaineth in this citie, shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, but he that goeth forth to the Caldeans, shall liue: for he shall haue his life for a pray, and shall liue.
\v 3 Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, This citie shall surely be giuen into the hand of the king of Babylons armie, which shall take it.
\v 4 \f + \fr 38:4 \ft Heb. peace.\f*Therefore the princes sayd vnto the king, We beseech thee let this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of warre that remaine in this citie, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words vnto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.
\v 5 Then Zedekiah the king sayd, Behold, he \add is\add* in your hand; for the king \add is\add* not \add he that\add* can do \add any\add* thing against you.
\v 6 \f + \fr 38:6 \ft Or, of the king.\f*Then tooke they Ieremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the sonne of Hammelech that \add was\add* in the court of the prison: and they let downe Ieremiah with cords: and in the dungeon \add there was\add* no water, but mire: so Ieremiah sunke in the mire.
\v 7 ¶ Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, one of y\sup e\sup* eunuches which was in the kings house, heard that they had put Ieremiah in the dungeon (the king then sitting in the gate of Beniamin)
\v 8 Ebed-melech went foorth out of the kings house, and spake to the king, saying,
\v 9 \f + \fr 38:9 \ft Hebr. he will die.\f*My lord the king, these men haue done euill in all that they haue done to Ieremiah the Prophet, whom they haue cast into the dungeon, and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is, for \add there is\add* no more bread in the city.
\v 10 \f + \fr 38:10 \ft Hebr. in thine hand.\f*Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirtie men with thee, and take vp Ieremiah the Prophet out of the dungeon before he die.
\v 11 So Ebed-melech tooke the men with him, and went into the house of the king vnder the treasurie, and tooke thence old cast cloutes, and old rotten ragges, and let them downe by cordes into the dungeon to Ieremiah.
\v 12 And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said vnto Ieremiah, Put now \add these\add* old cast cloutes and rotten ragges vnder thine arme-holes, vnder the cordes. And Ieremiah did so.
\v 13 So they drew vp Ieremiah with cordes, and tooke him vp out of the dungeon, and Ieremiah remained in the court of the prison.
\v 14 ¶ \f + \fr 38:14 \ft Or principall.\f*Then Zedekiah the king sent, and tooke Ieremiah the Prophet vnto him into the third entrie that \add is\add* in the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and the king said vnto Ieremiah, I will aske thee a thing: hide nothing from me.
\v 15 Then Ieremiah said vnto Zedekiah, If I declare \add it\add* vnto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I giue thee counsell, wilt thou not hearken vnto me?
\v 16 So the king sware secretly vnto Ieremiah, saying, As the \nd LORD\nd* liueth that made vs this soule, I wil not put thee to death, neither will I giue thee into the hand of these men that seeke thy life.
\v 17 Then said Ieremiah vnto Zedekiah, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* the God of hostes, the God of Israel, If thou wilt assuredly goe foorth vnto the king of Babylons Princes, then thy soule shall liue, and this Citie shall not be burnt with fire, and thou shalt liue, and thine house.
\v 18 But if thou wilt not goe foorth to the king of Babylons Princes, then shall this City be giuen into the hand of the Caldeans, and they shall burne it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.
\v 19 And Zedekiah the king said vnto Ieremiah, I am afraid of the Iewes that are fallen to the Caldeans, lest they deliuer mee into their hand, and they mocke me.
\v 20 But Ieremiah said, They shall not deliuer \add thee\add*: obey, I beseech thee, the voyce of the \nd LORD\nd*, which I speake vnto thee: so it shall be well vnto thee, and thy soule shall liue.
\v 21 But if thou refuse to goe foorth, this \add is\add* the word that the \nd LORD\nd* hath shewed me.
\v 22 \f + \fr 38:22 \ft Hebr. men of thy peace.\f*And behold, all the women that are left in the king of Iudahs house, \add shalbe\add* brought forth to the king of Babylons Princes, and those \add women\add* shall say, Thy friends haue set thee on, \add and\add* haue preuailed against thee: thy feet are sunke in the mire, and they are turned away backe.
\v 23 \f + \fr 38:23 \ft Hebr. thou shalt burne, &c.\f*So they shall bring out all thy wiues, and thy children to the Caldeans, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the King of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this citie to be burnt with fire.
\v 24 ¶ Then said Zedekiah vnto Ieremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.
\v 25 But if the Princes heare that I haue talked with thee, and they come vnto thee, and say vnto thee, Declare vnto vs now what thou hast said vnto the king; hide it not from vs, and wee wil not put thee to death; also what the king said vnto thee:
\v 26 Then thou shalt say vnto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to returne to Ionathans house to die there.
\v 27 \f + \fr 38:27 \ft Hebr. they were silent from him.\f*Then came all the Princes vnto Ieremiah, and asked him, and he told them according to all these words, that the king had commanded: so they left off speaking with him, for the matter was not perceiued.
\v 28 So Ieremiah abode in the court of the prison, vntill the day that Ierusalem was taken, and hee was \add there\add* when Ierusalem was taken.
\c 39
\iex 1 Ierusalem is taken. 4 Zedekiah is made blinde, and sent to Babylon. 8 The city ruinated, 9 the people captiuated. 11 Nebuchad-rezzars charge for the good vsage of Ieremiah. 15 Gods promise to Ebed-melech.

\v 2 \add And\add* in the eleuenth yeere of Zedekiah, in the fourth moneth, the ninth \add day\add* of the moneth, the citie was broken vp.

\v 5 Now while he was not yet gone backe, he sayd, Goe backe also to Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam the sonne of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made gouernour ouer all the cities of Iudah, and dwell with him among the people: or goe wheresoeuer it seemeth conuenient vnto thee to goe. So the captaine of the gard gaue him vitailes and a reward, and let him goe.
\v 6 Then went Ieremiah vnto Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam to Mizpah, and dwelt with him among the people, that were left in the land.
\v 7 ¶ Now when all the captaines of the forces which \add were\add* in the fields, \add euen\add* they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam gouernour in the land, and had committed vnto him men, and women and children, and of the poore of the land, of them that were not caried away captiue to Babylon;
\v 8 Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, euen Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah, and Iohanan, and Ionathan the sonnes of Kareah, and Seraiah the sonne of Tanhumeth, and the sonnes of Ephai the Netophathite, and Iezaniah the sonne of a Maachathite, they and their men.

\v 10 As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah to serue the Caldeans, which will come vnto vs: but yee, gather yee wine, and summer fruits, and oyle, and put \add them\add* in your vessels, and dwell in your cities, that yee haue taken.
\v 11 Likewise when all the Iewes that \add were\add* in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that \add were\add* in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Iudah, and that he had set ouer them Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam the sonne of Shaphan;
\v 12 Euen all the Iewes returned out of all places whither they were driuen, and came to the land of Iudah, to Gedaliah vnto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits, very much.
\v 13 ¶ Moreouer Iohanan the sonne of Kareah, and all the captaines of the forces that \add were\add* in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,
\v 14 \f + \fr 40:14 \ft Heb. to strike thee in soule?\f*And sayd vnto him, Doest thou certainly know, that Baalis the king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah to slay thee? But Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam beleeued them not.
\v 15 Then Iohanan the sonne of Kareah, spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me goe, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah, and no man shall know \add it\add*. Wherefore should he slay thee, that all the Iewes which are gathered vnto thee should be scattered, and the remnant in Iudah perish?
\v 16 But Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam sayd vnto Iohanan the sonne of Kareah; Thou shalt not do this thing, for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.
\c 41
\iex 1 Ishmael, trecherously killing Gedaliah and others, purposeth with the residue to flie vnto the Ammonites. 11 Iohanan recouereth the captiues, and mindeth to fly into Egypt.
\v 1 ¶ Now it came to passe in the seuenth moneth, \add that\add* Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah the sonne of Elishamah of the seede royall, and the princes of the king, euen tenne men with him, came vnto Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam to Mizpah, and there they did eate bread together in Mizpah.
\v 2 Then arose Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the sonne of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whome the king of Babylon had made gouernour ouer the land.
\v 3 Ishmael also slew all the Iewes that were with him, \add euen\add* with Gedaliah at Mizpah, \add and\add* the Caldeans that were found there, and the men of warre.
\v 4 And it came to passe the second day after he had slaine Gedaliah, and no man knew \add it\add*,
\v 5 That there came certaine from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, \add euen\add* fourescore men, hauing their beards shauen, and their clothes rent, and hauing cut themselues, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring \add them\add* to the house of the \nd LORD\nd*.

\v 7 And it was \add so\add* when they came into the midst of the citie, that Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah slew them, \add and cast them\add* into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that \add were\add* with him.
\v 8 But ten men were found among them, that said vnto Ishmael, Slay vs not: for we haue treasures in the field, of wheate, and of barley, and of oyle, and of hony: so he forbare, and slewe them not among their brethren.
\v 9 \f + \fr 41:9 \ft Or, neere Gedaliah, heb. by the hand or by the side of Gedaliah.\f*Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men (whom he had slaine because of Gedaliah) \add was\add* it, which Asa the king had made, for feare of Baasha king of Israel, \add and\add* Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah filled it with \add them that were\add* slaine.
\v 10 Then Ishmael caried away captiue all the residue of the people, that \add were\add* in Mizpah, \add euen\add* the kings daughters, and al the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captaine of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam, and Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah caried them away captiue, and departed to goe ouer to the Ammonites.
\v 11 ¶ But when Iohanan the sonne of Kareah, and all the captaines of the forces that \add were\add* with him, heard of all the euill that Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah had done,
\v 12 Then they tooke all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that \add are\add* in Gibeon.
\v 13 Now it came to passe \add that\add* when al the people which \add were\add* with Ishmael, sawe Iohanan the sonne of Kareah, and all the captaines of the forces, that \add were\add* with him, then they were glad.
\v 14 So all the people that Ishmael had caried away captiue from Mizpah cast about and returned, and went vnto Iohanan the sonne of Kareah.
\v 15 But Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah escaped from Iohanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites.
\v 16 Then tooke Iohanan the sonne of Kareah, and all the captaines of the forces that \add were\add* with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recouered from Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah, from Mizpah (after \add that\add* he had slaine Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam,) \add euen\add* mighty men of warre, and the women, and the children, and the eunuches whom he had brought againe from Gibeon.
\v 17 And they departed and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to goe to enter into Egypt,
\v 18 Because of the Caldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah had slaine Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made gouernour in the land.
\c 42
\iex 1 Iohanan desireth Ieremiah to enquire of God, promising obedience to his will. 7 Ieremiah assureth him of safety in Iudea, 13 and destruction in Egypt. 19 He reproueth their hypocrisie in requiring of the \nd LORD\nd*, that which they meant not.
\v 1 ¶ Then all the captaines of the forces, and Iohanan the sonne of Kareah, and Iezaniah the sonne of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least euen vnto the greatest, came neere,

\v 3 That the \nd LORD\nd* thy God may shew vs the way wherein we may walke, and the thing that we may doe.
\v 4 Then Ieremiah the prophet sayd vnto them, I haue heard \add you\add*; behold, I will pray vnto the \nd LORD\nd* your God, according to your words, and it shall come to passe \add that\add* whatsoeuer thing the \nd LORD\nd* shall answere you, I will declare \add it\add* vnto you: I will keepe nothing backe from you.
\v 5 Then they sayd to Ieremiah, The \nd LORD\nd* be a true and faithfull witnesse betweene vs, if we doe not, euen according to all things for the which the \nd LORD\nd* thy God shall send thee to vs.
\v 6 Whether \add it be\add* good, or whether \add it be\add* euill, we will obey the voice of the \nd LORD\nd* our God, to whom we send thee, that it may be well with vs, when we obey the voice of the \nd LORD\nd* our God.

\v 12 And I will shew mercies vnto you, that he may haue mercy vpon you; and cause you to returne to your owne land.
\v 13 ¶ But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of the \nd LORD\nd* your God,
\v 14 Saying, No, but we will goe into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no warre, nor heare the sound of the Trumpet, nor haue hunger of bread, and there will we dwell:

\iex 1 Iohanan, discrediting Ieremiahs prophecie, carieth Ieremiah and others into Egypt. 8 Ieremiah prophecieth by a type the conquest of Egypt, by the Babylonians.

\v 3 But Baruch the sonne of Neriah setteth thee on against vs, for to deliuer vs into the hand of the Caldeans, that they might put vs to death, and carie vs away captiues into Babylon.
\v 4 So Iohanan the sonne of Kareah, and all the captaines of the forces, and all the people, obeied not the voice of the \nd LORD\nd*, to dwell in the land of Iudah.

\v 5 But they hearkened not, nor enclined their eare to turne from their wickednes, to burne no incense vnto other gods.
\v 6 Wherefore my furie and mine anger was powred forth, and was kindled in the cities of Iudah, and in the streets of Ierusalem, and they are wasted \add and\add* desolate, as at this day.

\v 15 ¶ Then all the men which knew that their wiues had burnt incense vnto other Gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, euen all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt in Pathros, answered Ieremiah, saying,
