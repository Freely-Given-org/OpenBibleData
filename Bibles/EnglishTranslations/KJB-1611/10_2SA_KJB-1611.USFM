\iex 1 The Amalekite, who brought tidings of the ouerthrow, and accused himselfe of Sauls death, is slaine. 17 Dauid lamenteth Saul and Ionathan with a song.
\v 1 ¶ Now it came to passe after y\sup e\sup* death of Saul, when Dauid was returned from \x + \xo 1:1 \xt 1.Sam. 30.17.\x*the slaughter of the Amalekites, and Dauid had abode two daies in Ziklag,
\v 2 It came euen to passe on the third day, that behold, a man came out of the campe from Saul, with his clothes rent, and earth vpon his head: and \add so\add* it was when he came to Dauid, that hee fell to the earth, and did obeysance.
\v 3 And Dauid said vnto him, From whence commest thou? And he said vnto him, Out of the campe of Israel am I escaped.
\v 4 And Dauid said vnto him, \f + \fr 1:4 \ft Heb. what was &c.\f*How went the matter? I pray thee, tell mee. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battell, and many of the people also are fallen and dead, and Saul and Ionathan his sonne are dead also.
\v 5 And Dauid said vnto the yong man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Ionathan his sonne be dead?
\v 6 And the yong man that told him, said, As I happened by chance vpon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned vpon his speare: and loe, the charets and horsemen followed hard after him.
\v 7 And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called vnto mee: and I answered, \f + \fr 1:7 \ft Hebr. behold me.\f*Here \add am\add* I.
\v 8 And hee said vnto mee, Who \add art\add* thou? and I answered him, I \add am\add* an Amalekite.
\v 9 He said vnto me againe, Stand, I pray thee, vpon me, and slay me: for \f + \fr 1:9 \ft Or, my coat of male, (or, my embroidered coat) hindereth mee, that my, &c.\f*anguish is come vpon mee, because my life \add is\add* yet whole in me.
\v 10 So I stood vpon him, and slew him, because I was sure that hee could not liue after that hee was fallen: And I tooke the crowne that \add was\add* vpon his head, and the bracelet that \add was\add* on his arme, and haue brought them hither vnto my lord.
\v 11 Then Dauid tooke hold on his clothes, and \x + \xo 1:11 \xt Chap. 3.31. and 13.31.\x*rent them, and likewise all the men that \add were\add* with him.
\v 12 And they mourned and wept, and fasted vntill Euen, for Saul and for Ionathan his sonne, and for the people of the \nd LORD\nd*, and for the house of Israel, because they were fallen by the sword.
\v 13 ¶ And Dauid said vnto the yong man that told him, Whence \add art\add* thou? And he answered, I \add am\add* the sonne of a stranger, an Amalekite.
\v 14 And Dauid said vnto him, \x + \xo 1:14 \xt Psal. 105.15.\x*How wast thou not afraid to stretch foorth thine hand, to destroy the \nd LORD\nd*s Anointed?
\v 15 And Dauid called one of the yong men, and sayd, Goe neere, \add and\add* fall vpon him. And hee smote him, that hee dyed.
\v 16 And Dauid said vnto him, Thy blood \add be\add* vpon thy head: for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I haue slaine the \nd LORD\nd*s Annoynted.
\v 17 ¶ And Dauid lamented with this lamentation ouer Saul, and ouer Ionathan his sonne:
\v 18 (Also hee bade them teach the children of Iudah the vse of the bow: behold, \add it is\add* written \x + \xo 1:18 \xt Iosh. 10.13.\x*in the booke \f + \fr 1:18 \ft Or, of the vpright.\f*of Iasher.)
\v 19 The beauty of Israel is slaine vpon thy high places: how are the mightie fallen!
\v 20 \x + \xo 1:20 \xt Micah 1.10.\x*Tell \add it\add* not in Gath, publish \add it\add* not in the streetes of Askelon: lest the daughters of the Philistines reioyce, lest the daughters of the vncircumcised triumph.
\v 21 Yee mountaines of Gilboa, let there bee no dewe, neither \add let there be\add* raine vpon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mightie is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though hee had not beene annointed with oile.
\v 22 From the blood of the slaine, from the fat of the mightie, the bow of Ionathan turned not backe, and the sword of Saul returned not emptie.
\v 23 Saul and Ionathan \add were\add* louely and \f + \fr 1:23 \ft Or, sweet.\f*pleasant in their liues, and in their death they were not diuided: they were swifter then Eagles, they were stronger then Lions.
\v 24 Yee daughters of Israel, weepe ouer Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with \add other\add* delights, who put on ornaments of golde vpon your apparell.
\v 25 How are the mightie fallen in the midst of the battell! O Ionathan, \add thou wast\add* slaine in thine high places.
\v 26 I am distressed for thee, my brother Ionathan, very pleasant hast thou beene vnto mee: thy loue to mee was wonderfull, passing the loue of women.
\v 27 How are the mightie fallen, and the weapons of warre perished!

\iex 1 Dauid by Gods direction, with his companie goeth vp to Hebron, where he is made King of Iudah. 5 He commendeth them of Iabesh Gilead, for their kindnesse to Saul. 8 Abner maketh Ishbosheth king of Israel. 12 A mortall skirmish betweene twelue of Abners, and twelue of Ioabs men. 18 Asahel is slaine. 25 At Abners motion Ioab soundeth a retreat. 32 Asahels buriall.
\v 1 ¶ And it came to passe after this, that Dauid enquired of the \nd LORD\nd*, saying, Shall I goe vp into any of the Cities of Iudah? And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto him, Goe vp. And Dauid said, Whither shall I goe vp? And he said, Unto Hebron.
\v 2 So Dauid went vp thither, and his two wiues also, Ahinoam the Iezreelitesse, and Abigail Nabals wife the Carmelite.
\v 3 And his men that \add were\add* with him, did Dauid bring vp, euery man with his houshold: and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.
\v 4 And \x + \xo 2:4 \xt 1.Macc. 2.57.\x*the men of Iudah came, and there they anointed Dauid king ouer the house of Iudah: and they tolde Dauid, saying; \add That\add* \x + \xo 2:4 \xt 1.Sam. 31.13.\x*the men of Iabesh Gilead \add were they\add* that buried Saul.
\v 5 ¶ And Dauid sent messengers vnto the men of Iabesh Gilead, and said vnto them, Blessed \add be\add* ye of the \nd LORD\nd*, that ye haue shewed this kindnesse vnto your lord, \add euen\add* vnto Saul, and haue buried him.
\v 6 And now the \nd LORD\nd* shewe kindnesse and trueth vnto you: and I also will requite you this kindnesse, because ye haue done this thing.
\v 7 Therefore now let your handes be strengthened, and \f + \fr 2:7 \ft Heb. be ye the sonnes of valour.\f*be ye valiant: for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Iudah haue anointed me king ouer them.
\v 8 ¶ But Abner the sonne of Ner, captaine of \f + \fr 2:8 \ft Heb. the hoste which was Sauls.\f*Sauls hoste, tooke Ishbosheth the sonne of Saul, and brought him ouer to Mahanaim.
\v 9 And hee made him king ouer Gilead, and ouer the Ashurites, and ouer Iezreel, and ouer Ephraim, and ouer Beniamin, and ouer all Israel.
\v 10 Ishbosheth Sauls sonne \add was\add* fortie yeeres olde when he began to reigne ouer Israel, and reigned two yeres: but the house of Iudah followed Dauid.
\v 11 \f + \fr 2:11 \ft Heb. number of dayes.\f*(And the time that Dauid was King in Hebron ouer the house of Iudah, was seuen yeeres, and sixe moneths)
\v 12 ¶ And Abner the sonne of Ner, and the seruants of Ishbosheth the sonne of Saul, went out from Mahanaim, to Gibeon.
\v 13 \f + \fr 2:13 \ft Heb. them together.\f*And Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah, and the seruants of Dauid went out, and met together by the poole of Gibeon: and they sate downe, the one on the one side of the poole, and the other on the other side of the poole.
\v 14 And Abner said to Ioab, Let the yong men now arise, and play before vs: and Ioab saide, Let them arise.
\v 15 Then there arose and went ouer by number twelue of Beniamin, which \add pertained\add* to Ishbosheth the sonne of Saul, and twelue of the seruants of Dauid.
\v 16 \f + \fr 2:16 \ft That is, the field of strong men.\f*And they caught euery one his fellow by the head, and \add thrust\add* his sword in his fellowes side, so they fell downe together: Wherfore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim, which \add is\add* in Gibeon.
\v 17 And there was a very sore battell that day: and Abner was beaten, and the men of Israel, before the seruants of Dauid.
\v 18 ¶ \f + \fr 2:18 \ft Heb. of his feete.\f*\f + \fr 2:18 \ft Heb. as one of the Roes that is in the field.\f*And there were three sonnes of Zeruiah there, Ioab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel \add was as\add* light of foot as a wilde Roe.
\v 19 \f + \fr 2:19 \ft Heb. from after Abner.\f*And Asahel pursued after Abner, and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.
\v 20 Then Abner looked behind him, and said, \add Art\add* thou Asahel? And he answered, I \add am\add*.
\v 21 \f + \fr 2:21 \ft Or, spoile.\f*And Abner said to him, Turne thee aside to thy right hand, or to thy left, and lay thee holde on one of the yong men, and take thee his armour. But Asahel would not turne aside from following of him.
\v 22 And Abner said againe to Asahel, Turne thee aside from following me: Wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I holde vp my face to Ioab thy brother?
\v 23 Howbeit he refused to turne aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder ende of the speare smote him vnder the fift ribbe, \add that\add* the speare came out behinde him, and hee fell downe there, and died in the same place: and it came to passe, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell downe and died, stood still.
\v 24 Ioab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the Sunne went downe when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that \add lieth\add* before Giah by the way of the wildernesse of Gibeon.
\v 25 ¶ And the children of Beniamin gathered themselues together after Abner, and became one troupe, and stood on the top of an hill.
\v 26 Then Abner called to Ioab, and said, Shall the sword deuoure for euer? Knowest thou not that it wil be bitternesse in the latter end? How long shall it bee then, yer thou bid the people returne from following their brethren?
\v 27 \f + \fr 2:27 \ft Heb. from the morning.\f*\f + \fr 2:27 \ft Or, gone away.\f*And Ioab said, \add As\add* God liueth, vnlesse thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone vp euery one from following his brother.
\v 28 So Ioab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after Israel no more, neither fought they any more.
\v 29 And Abner and his men walked all that night thorow the plaine, and passed ouer Iordane, and went thorow all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.
\v 30 And Ioab returned from folowing Abner; and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of Dauids seruants nineteene men, and Asahel.
\v 31 But the seruants of Dauid had smitten of Beniamin and of Abners men, \add so that\add* three hundred and threescore men died.
\v 32 ¶ And they tooke vp Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father which \add was in\add* Bethlehem: and Ioab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at breake of day.

\iex 1 During the warre Dauid still waxeth stronger. 2 Sixe sonnes were borne to him in Hebron. 6 Abner displeased with Ishbosheth, 12 reuolteth to Dauid. 13 Dauid requireth a condition to bring him his wife Michal. 17 Abner hauing communed with the Israelites, is feasted by Dauid, and dismissed. 22 Ioab returning from battell, is displeased with the king, and killeth Abner. 28 Dauid curseth Ioab, 31 and mourneth for Abner.
\v 1 ¶ Now there was long war betweene the house of Saul, and the house of Dauid: but Dauid waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.
\v 2 ¶ And vnto Dauid were sonnes borne in Hebron: and his first borne was Ammon, of Ahinoam the Iezreelitesse.
\v 3 And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite: and the third, Absalom the sonne of Maacah, the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;
\v 4 And the fourth, Adoniiah the son of Haggith: and the fifth, Shephatiah the sonne of Abital;
\v 5 And the sixth, Ithream by Eglah Dauids wife: these were borne to Dauid in Hebron.
\v 6 ¶ And it came to passe while there was warre between the house of Saul and the house of Dauid, that Abner made himselfe strong for the house of Saul.
\v 7 \x + \xo 3:7 \xt Chap. 21.10.\x*And Saul had a concubine, whose name \add was\add* Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and \add Ishbosheth\add* saide to Abner, Wherefore hast thou gone in vnto my fathers concubine?
\v 8 Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, \add Am\add* I a dogs head, which against Iudah doe shew kindnesse this day vnto the house of Saul thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends, and haue not deliuered thee into the hand of Dauid, that thou chargest mee to day with a fault concerning this woman?
\v 9 So doe God to Abner, and more also, except, as the \nd LORD\nd* hath sworne to Dauid, euen so I doe to him:
\v 10 To translate the kingdome from the house of Saul, and to set vp the throne of Dauid ouer Israel, and ouer Iudah, from Dan euen to Beer-sheba.
\v 11 And he could not answere Abner a word againe, because he feared him.
\v 12 ¶ And Abner sent messengers to Dauid on his behalfe, saying, Whose \add is\add* the land? saying \add also\add*, Make thy league with me, and behold, my hand shall bee with thee, to bring about all Israel vnto thee.
\v 13 ¶ \f + \fr 3:13 \ft Hebr. saying.\f*And he said, Well, I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Sauls daughter, when thou commest to see my face.
\v 14 \x + \xo 3:14 \xt 1.Sam. 18.25, 27.\x*And Dauid sent messengers to Ishbosheth Sauls sonne, saying, Deliuer mee my wife Michal, which I espoused to mee for an hundred foreskinnes of the Philistines.
\v 15 \x + \xo 3:15 \xt 1 Sam.25.44. Phalti.\x*And Ishbosheth sent, and tooke her from \add her\add* husband, \add euen\add* from Phaltiel the sonne of Laish.
\v 16 \f + \fr 3:16 \ft Hebr. going, and weeping.\f*And her husband went with her along weeping behinde her to Bahurim: then said Abner vnto him, Goe, returne. And he returned.
\v 17 ¶ \f + \fr 3:17 \ft Hebr. both yesterday, and the third day.\f*And Abner had communication with the Elders of Israel, saying, Yee sought for Dauid in times past, \add to be\add* king ouer you.
\v 18 Now then doe \add it\add*, for the \nd LORD\nd* hath spoken of Dauid, saying; By the hand of my seruant Dauid I will saue my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.
\v 19 And Abner also spake in the eares of Beniamin: and Abner went also to speake in the eares of Dauid in Hebron, all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Beniamin.
\v 20 So Abner came to Dauid to Hebron, and twenty men with him: and Dauid made Abner, and the men that \add were\add* with him, a feast.
\v 21 And Abner said vnto Dauid, I will arise, and goe, and will gather all Israel vnto my lord the king, that they may make a league with thee, and that thou mayest raigne ouer all that thine heart desireth. And Dauid sent Abner away, and he went in peace.
\v 22 ¶ And behold, the seruants of Dauid, and Ioab came from \add pursuing\add* a troupe, and brought in a great spoile with them: (but Abner \add was\add* not with Dauid in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.)
\v 23 When Ioab and all the host that \add was\add* with him, were come, they told Ioab, saying, Abner the sonne of Ner came to the king, and he hath sent him away, and he is gone in peace.
\v 24 Then Ioab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done? behold, Abner came vnto thee, why \add is\add* it \add that\add* thou hast sent him away, & he is quite gone?
\v 25 Thou knowest Abner the sonne of Ner, that he came to deceiue thee, and to know thy going out, and thy comming in, & to know all that thou doest.
\v 26 And when Ioab was come out from Dauid, hee sent messengers after Abner, which brought him againe from the well of Siriah; but Dauid knew \add it\add* not.
\v 27 \x + \xo 3:27 \xt 1.King. 2.5.\x*\f + \fr 3:27 \ft Or, peaceably.\f*\x + \xo 3:27 \xt Chap.2.23.\x*And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Ioab tooke him aside in the gate to speake with him quietly: and smote him there vnder the fift ribbe, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.
\v 28 ¶ \f + \fr 3:28 \ft Heb. bloods\f*And afterward when Dauid heard \add it\add*, hee said, I and my kingdome \add are\add* guiltlesse before the \nd LORD\nd* for euer, from the blood of Abner the sonne of Ner:
\v 29 \f + \fr 3:29 \ft Heb. be cut off.\f*Let it rest on the head of Ioab, and on all his fathers house, & let there not faile from the house of Ioab one that hath an issue, or that is a leper, or that leaneth on a staffe, or that falleth on the sword, or that lacketh bread.
\v 30 \x + \xo 3:30 \xt Chap. 2.23.\x*So Ioab and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slaine their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battell.
\v 31 ¶ \f + \fr 3:31 \ft Heb. bed.\f*And Dauid said to Ioab, and to all the people that \add were\add* with him, Rent your clothes, and girde you with sackecloth, and mourne before Abner. And king Dauid \add himselfe\add* followed the biere.
\v 32 And they buried Abner in Hebron, and the king lift vp his voice, and wept at the graue of Abner; and all the people wept.
\v 33 And the king lamented ouer Abner, and said, Died Abner as a foole dieth?
\v 34 \f + \fr 3:34 \ft Heb. children of iniquitie.\f*Thy hands \add were\add* not bound, nor thy feete put into fetters: as a man falleth before wicked men, \add so\add* fellest thou. And all the people wept againe ouer him.
\v 35 And when all the people came to cause Dauid to eate meate while it was yet day, Dauid sware, saying, So doe God to mee, and more also, if I taste bread or ought else, till the Sunne be downe.
\v 36 \f + \fr 3:36 \ft Heb. was good in their eyes.\f*And all the people tooke notice \add of it\add*, and it pleased them: as whatsoeuer the King did, pleased all the people.
\v 37 For all the people, and all Israel vnderstood that day, that it was not of the King to slay Abner the sonne of Ner.
\v 38 And the King said vnto his seruants, Knowe yee not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?
\v 39 \f + \fr 3:39 \ft Heb. tender.\f*And I \add am\add* this day weake, though anointed King, and these men the sonnes of Zeruiah \add be\add* too hard for me: the \nd LORD\nd* shall reward the doer of euill, according to his wickednesse.

\iex 1 The Israelites being troubled at the death of Abner, 2 Baanah and Rechab slay Ishbosheth, and bring his head to Hebron. 9 Dauid causeth them to be slaine, and Ishbosheths head to be buried.
\v 1 ¶ And when Sauls sonne heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.
\v 2 \f + \fr 4:2 \ft Heb. second.\f*And Sauls sonne had two men \add that were\add* captaines of bands: the name of the one \add was\add* Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sonnes of Rimmon a Beerothite, of the children of Beniamin: (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Beniamin:
\v 3 And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were soiourners there vntill this day.)
\v 4 And Ionathan, Sauls sonne, had a sonne \add that was\add* lame of \add his\add* feete, and \add was\add* fiue yeeres olde when the tidings came of Saul and Ionathan out of Iezreel, and his nource tooke him vp, and fled: and it came to passe as she made haste to flee, that hee fell, and became lame, and his name was Mephibosheth.
\v 5 And the sonnes of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noone.
\v 6 And they came thither into the midst of the house, \add as though\add* they would haue fetched wheat, and they smote him vnder the fift \add rib\add*, and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.
\v 7 For when they came into the house, hee lay on his bedde in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him, and tooke his head, and gate them away thorow the plaine all night.
\v 8 And they brought the head of Ishbosheth vnto Dauid to Hebron, and said to the King, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the sonne of Saul, thine enemie, which sought thy life, and the \nd LORD\nd* hath auenged my lord the king this day of Saul and of his seed.
\v 9 ¶ And Dauid answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sonnes of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said vnto them, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liueth, who hath redeemed my soule out of all aduersitie,
\v 10 \x + \xo 4:10 \xt Chap. 1.15.\x*\f + \fr 4:10 \ft Heb. hee was in his owne eyes as a bringer, &c.\f*\f + \fr 4:10 \ft Or, which was the reward I gaue him for his tidings.\f*When one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, ( thinking to haue brought good tidings) I tooke hold of him, and slew him in Ziklag, who \add thought\add* that I would haue giuen him a reward for his tidings:
\v 11 How much more, when wicked men haue slaine a righteous person, in his owne house, vpon his bed? Shall I not therefore now require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth?
\v 12 \x + \xo 4:12 \xt Chap. 3.32.\x*And Dauid commanded his yong men, and they slew them, and cut off their hands and their feete, and hanged \add them\add* vp ouer the poole in Hebron: but they tooke the head of Ishbosheth, and buried \add it\add* in the sepulchre of Abner, in Hebron.

\iex 1 The tribes come to Hebron to annoint Dauid ouer Israel. 4 Dauids age. 6 Hee taking Zion from the Iebusites dwelleth in it. 11 Hiram sendeth to Dauid. 13 Eleuen sonnes are borne to him in Ierusalem. 17 Dauid directed by God smiteth the Philistines at Baal Perazim, 22 and againe at the Mulberie trees.
\v 1 ¶ \x + \xo 5:1 \xt 1.Chron. 11.1.\x*Then came all the tribes of Israel to Dauid vnto Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we \add are\add* thy bone, and thy flesh.
\v 2 \x + \xo 5:2 \xt Psal. 78.71.\x*Also in time past when Saul was king ouer vs, thou wast hee that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the \nd LORD\nd* said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt bee a captaine ouer Israel.
\v 3 So all the Elders of Israel came to the King to Hebron, and King Dauid made a league with them in Hebron before the \nd LORD\nd*: and they anointed Dauid King ouer Israel.
\v 4 ¶ Dauid \add was\add* thirtie yeeres old when he began to reigne, \add and\add* he reigned fourtie yeeres.
\v 5 \x + \xo 5:5 \xt Chap.2.11\x*In Hebron he reigned ouer Iudah seuen yeeres, and sixe moneths: and in Ierusalem he reigned thirty and three yeres ouer all Israel and Iudah.
\v 6 ¶ \f + \fr 5:6 \ft Or, saying, Dauid shall not &c.\f*And the king and his men went to Ierusalem, vnto the Iebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spake vnto Dauid, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: Thinking, Dauid cannot come in hither.
\v 7 Neuerthelesse, Dauid tooke the strong hold of Zion: the same \add is\add* the citie of Dauid.
\v 8 \x + \xo 5:8 \xt 1.Chron. 11.6.\x*\f + \fr 5:8 \ft Or, because they had said euen the blind & the lame, He shal not come into the house.\f*And Dauid said on that day, Whosoeuer getteth vp to the gutter, and smiteth the Iebusites, and the lame, and the blind, \add that are\add* hated of Dauids soule, he shall be chiefe and captaine: Wherefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.
\v 9 So Dauid dwelt in the fort, and called it the citie of Dauid, and Dauid built round about, from Millo and inward.
\v 10 \f + \fr 5:10 \ft Heb. went, going and growing.\f*And Dauid went on, and grew great, and the \nd LORD\nd* God of hosts \add was\add* with him.
\v 11 ¶ \x + \xo 5:11 \xt 1.Chron. 14.1.\x*\f + \fr 5:11 \ft Hebr. hewers of the stone of the wall.\f*And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to Dauid, and Cedar trees, and carpenters, and Masons: and they built Dauid an house.
\v 12 And Dauid perceiued that the \nd LORD\nd* had established him King ouer Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdome for his people Israels sake.
\v 13 ¶ \x + \xo 5:13 \xt 1.Chron. 3.9.\x*And Dauid tooke \add him\add* mo concubines and wiues out of Ierusalem, after he was come from Hebron, and there were yet sonnes and daughters borne to Dauid.
\v 14 \x + \xo 5:14 \xt 1.Chron. 3.5.\x*And these \add be\add* the names of those that were borne vnto him in Ierusalem, Shammua, & Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon:

\v 9 But Uriah slept at the doore of the kings house, with all the seruants of his lord, and went not downe to his house.
\v 10 And when they had tolde Dauid, saying, Uriah went not downe vnto his house, Dauid said vnto Uriah, Camest thou not from \add thy\add* iourney? why \add then\add* diddest thou not goe downe vnto thine house?
\v 11 And Uriah said vnto Dauid, The Arke, and Israel, and Iudah abide in tents, and my lord Ioab, and the seruants of my lord are encamped in the open fields; shall I then goe into mine house, to eate and to drinke, and to lie with my wife? As thou liuest, and as thy soule liueth, I will not doe this thing.
\v 12 And Dauid said to Uriah, Tary here to day also, and to morow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Ierusalem that day, and the morrow.
\v 13 And when Dauid had called him, hee did eate and drinke before him, and he made him drunke: and at euen hee went out to lie on his bed with the seruants of his lord, but went not downe to his house.
\v 14 ¶ And it came to passe in the morning, that Dauid wrote a letter to Ioab, and sent \add it\add* by the hand of Uriah.

\v 16 And it came to passe when Ioab obserued the citie, that he assigned Uriah vnto a place where hee knewe that valiant men \add were\add*.
\v 17 And the men of the city went out, and fought with Ioab: and there fell \add some\add* of the people of the seruants of Dauid, and Uriah the Hittite died also.
\v 18 ¶ Then Ioab sent, and tolde Dauid all the things concerning the warre:
\v 19 And charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast made an ende of telling the matters of the warre vnto the King;
\v 20 And if so be that the kings wrath arise, and hee say vnto thee, Wherefore approched ye so nigh vnto the city when yee did fight? Knew yee not that they would shoot from the wall?
\v 21 \x + \xo 11:21 \xt Iudg. 9.53.\x*Who smote Abimelech the sonne of Ierubesheth? Did not a woman cast a piece of a milstone vpon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? why went ye nigh the wall? Then say thou, Thy seruant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.
\v 22 ¶ So the messenger went, and came and shewed Dauid all that Ioab had sent him for.
\v 23 And the messenger said vnto Dauid, Surely the men preuailed against vs, and came out vnto vs into the field, and we were vpon them euen vnto the entring of the gate.
\v 24 And the shooters shot from off the wall vpon thy seruants, and \add some\add* of the Kings seruants be dead, and thy seruant Uriah the Hittite is dead also.

\v 26 ¶ And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her husband was dead, she mourned for her husband.

\iex 1 Nathans parable of the Ewe lambe, causeth Dauid to be his owne Iudge. 7 Dauid, reproued by Nathan, confesseth his sinne and is pardoned. 15 Dauid mourneth and prayeth for the childe, while it liued. 24 Salomon is borne and named Iedidiah. 26 Dauid taketh Rabbah, and tortureth the people thereof.
\v 1 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* sent Nathan vnto Dauid: and he came vnto him, and said vnto him, There were two men in one citie; the one rich, and the other poore.
\v 2 The rich \add man\add* had exceeding many flockes and herds.
\v 3 \f + \fr 12:3 \ft Heb. morsell.\f*But the poore \add man\add* had nothing saue one litle ewe lambe, which he had bought and nourished vp: and it grew vp together with him, and with his children, it did eate of his owne meate, and dranke of his owne cup, and lay in his bosome, and was vnto him as a daughter.
\v 4 And there came a traueller vnto the rich man, and he spared to take of his owne flocke, and of his owne herd, to dresse for the wayfaring man that was come vnto him, but tooke the poore mans lambe, and dressed it for the man that was come to him.
\v 5 \f + \fr 12:5 \ft Or, is worthy to die.\f*And Dauids anger was greatly kindled against the man, and he said to Nathan, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liueth, the man that hath done this \add thing\add*, shall surely die.
\v 6 \x + \xo 12:6 \xt Exo. 22.1\x*And he shall restore the Lambe fourefold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pittie.
\v 7 ¶ \x + \xo 12:7 \xt Sam. 16.13.\x*And Nathan said to Dauid, Thou \add art\add* the man: thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, I anointed thee king ouer Israel, and I deliuered thee out of the hand of Saul,
\v 8 And I gaue thee thy Masters house, and thy Masters wiues into thy bosome, and gaue thee the house of Israel and of Iudah, and if that had bene too litle, I would moreouer haue giuen vnto thee such and such things.
\v 9 Wherefore hast thou despised the commandement of the \nd LORD\nd*, to doe euill in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and hast taken his wife \add to be\add* thy wife, and hast slaine him with the sword of the children of Ammon.
\v 10 Now therefore the sword shall neuer depart from thine house, because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite, to be thy wife.
\v 11 \x + \xo 12:11 \xt Deut. 28.30. chap. 16.22.\x*Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Behold, I will raise vp euill against thee out of thine owne house, and I will take thy wiues before thine eyes, and giue \add them\add* vnto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wiues in the sight of this Sunne.

\v 13 \x + \xo 12:13 \xt Ecclus. 47.11.\x*And Dauid saide vnto Nathan, I haue sinned against the \nd LORD\nd*. And Nathan saide vnto Dauid, The \nd LORD\nd* also hath put away thy sinne, thou shalt not die.
\v 14 Howbeit, because by this deede thou hast giuen great occasion to the enemies of the \nd LORD\nd* to blaspheme, the childe also \add that is\add* borne vnto thee, shall surely die.
\v 15 ¶ And Nathan departed vnto his house: and the \nd LORD\nd* strake the childe that Uriahs wife bare vnto Dauid, and it was very sicke.
\v 16 \f + \fr 12:16 \ft Heb. fasted a fast.\f*Dauid therfore besought God for the childe, and Dauid fasted, and went in, and lay all night vpon the earth.

\v 19 But when Dauid saw that his seruants whispered, Dauid perceiued that the childe was dead: therefore Dauid said vnto his seruants, Is the child dead? and they said, He is dead.
\v 20 Then Dauid arose from the earth and washed, and anointed \add himselfe\add*, and changed his apparell, and came into the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and worshipped: then hee came to his owne house, and when he required, they set bread before him, and he did eate.
\v 21 Then said his seruants vnto him, What thing \add is\add* this that thou hast done? thou didst fast and weepe for the childe, \add while it was\add* aliue, but when the childe was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.
\v 22 And he said, While the child was yet aliue, I fasted and wept: for I said, Who can tell, \add whether\add* God will be gracious to me, that the child may liue?
\v 23 But now hee is dead, Wherefore should I fast? Can I bring him backe againe? I shall goe to him, but he shall not returne to me.
\v 24 ¶ \x + \xo 12:24 \xt Matt.1.6.\x*And Dauid comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in vnto her, and lay with her: and she bare a sonne, and he called his name Solomon, and the \nd LORD\nd* loued him.

\v 27 And Ioab sent messengers to Dauid, and said, I haue fought against Rabbah, and haue taken the citie of waters.

\v 31 And he brought foorth the people that \add were\add* therein, and put \add them\add* vnder sawes, and vnder harrowes of yron, and vnder axes of yron, and made them passe through the bricke-kilne: And thus did he vnto all the cities of the children of Ammon.

\iex 1 Amnon louing Tamar, by Ionadabs counsell faining himselfe sicke, rauisheth her. 15 Hee hateth her, and shamefully turneth her away. 19 Absalom entertaineth her, and concealeth his purpose. 23 At a sheepeshearing, among all the Kings sonnes, hee killeth Amnon. 30 Dauid grieuing at the newes is comforted by Ionadab. 37 Absalom flieth to Talmai at Geshur.
\v 1 ¶ And it came to passe after this, that Absalom the sonne of Dauid had a faire sister, whose name \add was\add* Tamar: and Amnon the sonne of Dauid loued her.
\v 2 \f + \fr 13:2 \ft Heb. it was maruelous or hidden in the eyes of Amnon.\f*And Amnon was so vexed, that he fell sicke for his sister Tamar: for she \add was\add* a virgine, and Amnon thought it hard for him to doe any thing to her.
\v 3 But Amnon had a friend, whose name \add was\add* Ionadab, the sonne of Shimeah, Dauids brother: and Ionadab \add was\add* a very subtill man.
\v 4 \f + \fr 13:4 \ft Heb. thin.\f*\f + \fr 13:4 \ft Heb. morning by morning.\f*And he saide vnto him, Why \add art\add* thou, \add being\add* the Kings sonne, leane from day to day? Wilt thou not tel me? and Amnon said vnto him, I loue Tamar my brother Absaloms sister.
\v 5 And Ionadab said vnto him, Lay thee downe on thy bed, and make thy selfe sicke: and when thy father commeth to see thee, say vnto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come, and giue me meat, and dresse the meat in my sight, that I may see \add it\add*, and eate \add it\add* at her hand.
\v 6 ¶ So Amnon lay downe, and made himselfe sicke: and when the king was come to see him, Amnon said vnto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar my sister come, & make me a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat at her hand.
\v 7 Then Dauid sent home to Tamar, saying, Goe now to thy brother Amnons house, and dresse him meat.
\v 8 \f + \fr 13:8 \ft Or, paste.\f*So Tamar went to her brother Amnons house (and hee was laide downe) and she tooke flowre, and kneaded \add it\add*, and made cakes in his sight, and did bake the cakes.
\v 9 And she tooke a pan, and powred \add them\add* out before him, but hee refused to eate: and Amnon said, Haue out all men from mee: And they went out euery man from him.
\v 10 And Amnon saide vnto Tamar, Bring the meate into the chamber, that I may eate of thine hand. And Tamar tooke the cakes which shee had made, and brought \add them\add* into the chamber to Amnon her brother.
\v 11 And when shee had brought \add them\add* vnto him to eate, hee tooke hold of her, and said vnto her, Come lye with mee, my sister.
\v 12 \f + \fr 13:12 \ft Heb. humble me.\f*\x + \xo 13:12 \xt Leuit. 18.9.\x*\f + \fr 13:12 \ft Heb. It ought not so to be done.\f*And she answered him, Nay, my brother, doe not force me: for no such thing ought to bee done in Israel; doe not thou this folly.
\v 13 And I, whither shall I cause my shame to goe? and as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fooles in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, speake vnto the king, for he will not withhold me from thee.
\v 14 Howbeit hee would not hearken vnto her voice, but being stronger then shee, forced her, and lay with her.
\v 15 ¶ \f + \fr 13:15 \ft Heb. with great hatred greatly.\f*Then Amnon hated her exceedingly, so that the hatred wherwith he hated her, \add was\add* greater then the loue wherewith hee had loued her: And Amnon said vnto her, Arise, be gone.
\v 16 And she said vnto him, \add There is\add* no cause: this euill in sending me away, \add is\add* greater then the other that thou diddest vnto me: But he would not hearken vnto her.
\v 17 Then hee called his seruant that ministred vnto him, and said, Put now this \add woman\add* out from mee, and bolt the doore after her.
\v 18 And shee had a garment of diuers colours vpon her: for with such robes were the Kings daughters, \add that were\add* virgins, apparelled. Then his seruant brought her out, and bolted the doore after her.
\v 19 ¶ And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent her garment of diuers colours that \add was\add* on her, and layde her hand on her head, and went on, crying.
\v 20 \f + \fr 13:20 \ft Heb. set not thine heart.\f*\f + \fr 13:20 \ft Heb. and desolate.\f*And Absalom her brother sayde vnto her, Hath Amnon thy brother beene with thee? But holde nowe thy peace, my sister: he \add is\add* thy brother, regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absaloms house.
\v 21 ¶ But when King Dauid heard of all these things, he was very wroth.
\v 22 And Absalom spake vnto his brother Amnon neither good nor bad: for Absalom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.
\v 23 ¶ And it came to passe after two full yeeres, that Absalom had sheepeshearers in Baal-Hazor, which \add is\add* beside Ephraim: and Absalom inuited all the kings sonnes.
\v 24 And Absalom came to the King, and said, Behold now, thy seruant hath sheepe-shearers, Let the King, I beseech thee, and his seruants, goe with thy seruant.
\v 25 And the King sayde to Absalom, Nay, my sonne, let vs not all now goe, lest we be chargeable vnto thee. And he pressed him: howbeit he would not goe, but blessed him.
\v 26 Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon goe with vs. And the King said vnto him, Why should he goe with thee?
\v 27 But Absalom pressed him, that he let Amnon and all the kings sonnes goe with him.
\v 28 ¶ \f + \fr 13:28 \ft Or, will you not, since I haue commanded you?\f*\f + \fr 13:28 \ft Heb. sonnes of valour.\f*Now Absalom had commanded his seruants, saying, Marke yee now when Amnons heart is merrie with wine, and when I say vnto you, Smite Amnon, then kill him, feare not: haue not I commanded you? be couragious, and be valiant.
\v 29 \f + \fr 13:29 \ft Heb. rode.\f*And the seruants of Absalom did vnto Amnon as Absalom had commanded: then all the Kings sonnes arose, and euery man gate him vp vpon his mule, and fled.
\v 30 ¶ And it came to passe while they were in the way, that tidings came to Dauid, saying, Absalom hath slaine all the Kings sonnes, and there is not one of them left.
\v 31 Then the king arose, and tare his garments, and lay on the earth: and all his seruants stoode by with their clothes rent.
\v 32 \f + \fr 13:32 \ft Heb. mouth\f*\f + \fr 13:32 \ft Or, setled.\f*And Ionadab the sonne of Shimeah Dauids brother, answered and said, Let not my lord suppose \add that\add* they haue slaine all the yong men the Kings sonnes; for Amnon onely is dead: for by the appointment of Absalom this hath beene determined, from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.
\v 33 Now therefore let not my lord the King take the thing to his heart, to thinke that all the Kings sonnes are dead: for Amnon onely is dead.
\v 34 But Absalom fled: and the yong man that kept the watch, lift vp his eyes, and looked, and behold, there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him.
\v 35 \f + \fr 13:35 \ft Heb. according to the word of thy seruant.\f*And Ionadab said vnto the king, Behold, the kings sonnes come: as thy seruant said, so it is.
\v 36 \f + \fr 13:36 \ft Hebr. with a great weeping greatly.\f*And it came to passe assoone as hee had made an ende of speaking, that behold, the kings sonnes came, and lift vp their voice, and wept; and the King also and all his seruants wept very sore.
\v 37 ¶ \f + \fr 13:37 \ft Or, Ammihur.\f*But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai the sonne of Ammihud king of Geshur: and \add Dauid\add* mourned for his sonne euery day.
\v 38 So Absalom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three yeeres.

\iex 1 Ioab, suborning a widow of Tekoah, by a parable to incline the Kings heart to fetch home Absalom, bringeth him to Hierusalem. 25 Absaloms beautie, haire, and children. 28 After two yeres, Absalom by Ioab is brought into the Kings presence.
\v 1 ¶ Now Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah, perceiued that the kings heart \add was\add* toward Absalom.
\v 2 And Ioab sent to Tekoah, and fetcht thence a wise woman, and said vnto her, I pray thee, faine thy selfe to be a mourner, and put on now mourning apparel, and anoint not thy selfe with oile, but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead:
\v 3 And come to the king, and speake on this maner vnto him: so Ioab put the words in her mouth.
\v 4 ¶ \f + \fr 14:4 \ft Hebr. saue.\f*And when the woman of Tekoah spake to the king, shee fell on her face to the ground, and did obeysance, and said, Helpe, O king.
\v 5 And the king said vnto her, What aileth thee? And she answered, I \add am\add* indeed a widow woman, and mine husband is dead.
\v 6 \f + \fr 14:6 \ft Hebr. no deliuerer betweene them.\f*And thy handmayd had two sonnes, and they two stroue together in the field, and \add there was\add* none to part them, but the one smote the other, and slew him.

\v 8 And the king saide vnto the woman, Goe to thine house, and I will giue charge concerning thee.
\v 9 And the woman of Tekoah said vnto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquitie \add bee\add* on mee, and on my fathers house: and the king and his throne \add bee\add* guiltlesse.
\v 10 And the king said, Whosoeuer saith \add ought\add* vnto thee, bring him to mee, and he shall not touch thee any more.
\v 11 \f + \fr 14:11 \ft Hebr. that the reuenger of blood doe not multiply to destroy.\f*Then said she, I pray thee, let the king remember the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, that thou wouldest not suffer the reuengers of blood to destroy any more, lest they destroy my sonne. And he said, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liueth, there shall not one haire of thy sonne fall to the earth.
\v 12 Then the woman said, Let thine handmayd, I pray thee, speake \add one\add* word vnto my lord the king. And hee said, Say on.
\v 13 And the woman said, Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? For the king doeth speake this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king doeth not fetch home againe his banished.
\v 14 \f + \fr 14:14 \ft Or, because God hath not taken away his life, he hath also deuised meanes, &c.\f*For we must needs die, and \add are\add* as water spilt on the ground, which cannot bee gathered vp againe: neither doeth God respect \add any\add* person, yet doeth he deuise meanes, that his banished bee not expelled from him.
\v 15 Now therefore that I am come to speake of this thing vnto my lord the king, \add it is\add* because the people haue made me afraid: and thy handmayd said, I will now speake vnto the king; it may bee that the king will performe the request of his handmayd.

\v 18 Then the king answered and said vnto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall aske thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speake.
\v 19 And the king said, \add Is not\add* the hand of Ioab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, \add As\add* thy soule liueth, my lord the king, none can turne to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken: for thy seruant Ioab, hee bade me, and he put all these wordes in the mouth of thine handmaid:

\v 23 So Ioab arose, and went to Geshur, & brought Absalom to Ierusalem.
\v 24 And the king said, Let him turne to his owne house, & let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his owne house, and sawe not the kings face.
\v 25 ¶ \f + \fr 14:25 \ft Heb. and as Absalom there was not a beautifull man in all Israel, to praise greatly.\f*But in all Israel there was none to be so much praised as Absalom, for his beautie: from the sole of his foot euen to the crowne of his head, there was no blemish in him.
\v 26 And when he polled his head, (for it was at euery yeres end that he polled \add it\add*: because the haire was heauy on him, therefore he polled it) hee weighed the haire of his head at two hundred shekels after the kings weight.
\v 27 And vnto Absalom there were borne three sonnes, and one daughter, whose name \add was\add* Tamar: shee was a woman of a faire countenance.
\v 28 ¶ So Absalom dwelt two full yeeres in Ierusalem, and saw not the kings face.
\v 29 Therefore Absalom sent for Ioab, to haue sent him to the king, but hee would not come to him: and when hee sent againe the second time, hee would not come.

\v 31 Then Ioab arose, and came to Absalom vnto \add his\add* house, and said vnto him, Wherefore haue thy seruants set my field on fire?
\v 32 And Absalom answered Ioab, Behold, I sent vnto thee, saying, come hither, that I may send thee to the king to say, Wherefore am I come from Geshur? It had bene good for mee to haue bene there still: now therefore let me see the kings face: and if there bee \add any\add* iniquitie in me, let him kill me.
\v 33 So Ioab came to the King, and told him: and when hee had called for Absalom, he came to the king, and bowed himselfe on his face to the ground before the king, and the King kissed Absalom.

\iex 1 Absalom, by faire speeches and courtesies, stealeth the hearts of Israel. 7 Vnder pretence of a vow he obtaineth leaue to go to Hebron. 10 He maketh there a great conspiracie. 13 Dauid vpon the newes fleeth from Ierusalem. 19 Ittai would not leaue him. 24 Zadok and Abiathar are sent backe with the Arke. 30 Dauid and his companie go vp mount Oliuet weeping. 31 He curseth Ahithophels counsel. 32 Hushai is sent backe with instructions.
\v 1 ¶ And it came to passe after this, that Absalom prepared him charets and horses, and fiftie men to runne before him.
\v 2 \f + \fr 15:2 \ft Hebr. to come.\f*And Absalom rose vp earely, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was \add so\add*, that when any man that had a controuersie, came to the king for iudgment, then Absalom called vnto him, and said, Of what citie \add art\add* thou? And he said, Thy seruant \add is\add* of one of the tribes of Israel.
\v 3 \f + \fr 15:3 \ft Or, none will heare you from the king downward.\f*And Absalom said vnto him, See, thy matters \add are\add* good & right, but \add there is\add* no man \add deputed\add* of the king to heare thee.
\v 4 Absalom said moreouer, Oh that I were made Iudge in the land, that euery man which hath any suit or cause, might come vnto me, and I would do him iustice.
\v 5 And it was \add so\add*, that when any man came nigh \add to him\add*, to doe him obeisance, he put foorth his hand, and tooke him, and kissed him.
\v 6 And on this maner did Absalom to all Israel, that came to the King for iudgement: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
\v 7 ¶ And it came to passe after fourtie yeeres, that Absalom said vnto the king, I pray thee, let mee goe and pay my vow which I haue vowed vnto the \nd LORD\nd* in Hebron.
\v 8 For thy seruant vowed a vowe while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the \nd LORD\nd* shall bring mee againe in deed to Ierusalem, then I will serue the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 9 And the king said vnto him, Goe in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.
\v 10 ¶ But Absalom sent spies thorowout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soone as yee heare the sound of the trumpet, then yee shall say, Absalom reigneth in Hebron.
\v 11 And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Ierusalem, \add that were\add* called, and they went in their simplicitie, and they knew not any thing.
\v 12 And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, Dauids counseller, from his citie, \add euen\add* from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices: and the conspiracie was strong, for the people encreased continually with Absalom.
\v 13 ¶ And there came a messenger to Dauid, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.
\v 14 \f + \fr 15:14 \ft Heb. thrust\f*And Dauid said vnto all his seruants that \add were\add* with him at Ierusalem, Arise, and let vs flee; for wee shall not \add else\add* escape from Absalom: make speede to depart, lest hee ouertake vs suddenly, and bring euill vpon vs, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.
\v 15 \f + \fr 15:15 \ft Heb. chuse.\f*And the kings seruants said vnto the king, Behold, thy seruants are readie to doe whatsoeuer my lord the king shall appoint.
\v 16 \f + \fr 15:16 \ft Heb. at his feete.\f*And the king went foorth, and all his houshold after him: and the King left tenne women, \add which were\add* concubines, to keepe the house.
\v 17 And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and taried in a place that was farre off.
\v 18 And all his seruants passed on beside him: and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, sixe hundred men, which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.
\v 19 ¶ Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Wherefore goest thou also with vs? Returne to thy place, and abide with the King: for thou \add art\add* a stranger, and also an exile.
\v 20 \f + \fr 15:20 \ft Heb. make thee wander in going?\f*Whereas thou camest \add but\add* yesterday, should I this day make thee goe vp and downe with vs? Seeing I goe whither I may, returne thou, and take backe thy brethren: mercie and trueth \add be\add* with thee.
\v 21 And Ittai answered the King, and said, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liueth, and \add as\add* my lord the king liueth, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, euen there also will thy seruant be.
\v 22 And Dauid said to Ittai, Goe, and passe ouer. And Ittai the Gittite passed ouer, and all his men, and all the little ones that \add were\add* with him.
\v 23 \x + \xo 15:23 \xt Called Ioh. 18.1. Cedron.\x*And all the countrey wept with a loude voice, and all the people passed ouer: the King also himselfe passed ouer the brooke Kidron, and all the people passed ouer, toward the way of the wildernesse.
\v 24 ¶ And loe, Zadok also, and all the Leuites \add were\add* with him, bearing the Arke of the Couenant of God, and they set downe the Arke of God; and Abiathar went vp, vntill all the people had done passing out of the citie.
\v 25 And the King said vnto Zadok, Cary backe the Arke of God into the citie: if I shall finde fauour in the eyes of the \nd LORD\nd*, he wil bring me againe, and shew me \add both\add* it, and his habitation.
\v 26 But if he thus say, I haue no delight in thee: beholde, \add here am\add* I, let him doe to me, as seemeth good vnto him.
\v 27 \x + \xo 15:27 \xt 1.Sam. 9.9.\x*The king said also vnto Zadok the Priest, \add Art not\add* thou a Seer? Returne into the citie in peace, and your two sonnes with you, Ahimaaz thy sonne, and Ionathan the sonne of Abiathar.
\v 28 See, I will tarie in the plaine of the wildernesse, vntill there come word from you to certifie me.
\v 29 Zadok therefore and Abiathar caried the Arke of God againe to Ierusalem; and they taried there.
\v 30 ¶ \f + \fr 15:30 \ft Heb. going vp and weeping.\f*And Dauid went vp by the ascent of \add mount\add* Oliuet, and wept as he went vp, and had his head couered, and he went barefoote, and all the people that \add was\add* with him, couered euery man his head, and they went vp, weeping as they went vp.
\v 31 ¶ And \add one\add* tolde Dauid, saying, Ahithophel \add is\add* among the conspirators with Absalom. And Dauid sayde, O \nd LORD\nd*, I pray thee turne the counsell of Ahithophel into foolishnesse.
\v 32 ¶ And it came to passe, that \add when\add* Dauid was come to the top \add of the mount\add*, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him, with his coat rent, and earth vpon his head:
\v 33 Unto whom Dauid said, If thou passest on with me, then thou shalt be a burden vnto me.
\v 34 But if thou returne to the citie, and say vnto Absalom, I wil be thy seruant, O king: \add as\add* I haue bene thy fathers seruant hitherto, so \add will\add* I now also \add be\add* thy seruant: then mayest thou for mee defeat the counsell of Ahithophel.
\v 35 And \add hast thou\add* not there with thee Zadok, and Abiathar the Priests? therefore it shall be, \add that\add* what thing soeuer thou shalt heare out of the kings house, thou shalt tell \add it\add* to Zadok and Abiathar the Priests.
\v 36 Behold, \add they haue\add* there with them their two sonnes, Ahimaaz Zadoks sonne, and Ionathan Abiathars sonne: and by them ye shall send vnto me euery thing that ye can heare.
\v 37 So Hushai Dauids friend came into the citie, and Absalom came into Ierusalem.
\c 16
\iex 1 Ziba by presents and false suggestions, obtaineth his masters inheritance. 5 At Bahurim Shimei curseth Dauid. 9 Dauid with patience abstaineth, and restraineth others from reuenge. 15 Hushai insinuateth himselfe into Absaloms counsaile. 20 Ahithophels counsaile.
\v 1 ¶ And when Dauid was a little past the top \add of the hill\add*, Beholde, Ziba the seruant of Mephibosheth met him with a couple of asses sadled, and vpon them two hundred \add loaues\add* of bread, and an hundred bunches of raisins, and an hundred of summer fruits, and a bottell of wine.
\v 2 And the King saide vnto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba saide, The asses bee for the kings houshold to ride on, and the bread and summer fruit for the yong men to eate, and the wine, that such as \add be\add* faint in the wildernesse, may drinke.
\v 3 And the king said, And where \add is\add* thy masters sonne? and Ziba said vnto the king, Behold, he abideth at Ierusalem: for hee said, To day shall the house of Israel restore mee the kingdome of my father.
\v 4 \f + \fr 16:4 \ft Hebr. I doe obeysance.\f*Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine \add are\add* all that \add pertained\add* vnto Mephibosheth. And Ziba saide, I humbly beseech thee \add that\add* I may finde grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.
\v 5 ¶ \f + \fr 16:5 \ft Or, he still came foorth and cursed.\f*And when king Dauid came to Bahurim, behold, thence came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name \add was\add* Shimei the sonne of Gera: hee came foorth, and cursed still as he came.
\v 6 And he cast stones at Dauid, and at all the seruants of king Dauid: and all the people, and all the mighty men \add were\add* on his right hand, and on his left.
\v 7 \f + \fr 16:7 \ft Hebr. man of blood.\f*And thus said Shimei when hee cursed, Come out, come out thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial:
\v 8 \f + \fr 16:8 \ft Hebr. behold thee in thy euill.\f*The \nd LORD\nd* hath returned vpon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose stead thou hast raigned, and the \nd LORD\nd* hath deliuered the kingdome into the hand of Absalom thy sonne: and behold, thou \add art taken\add* to thy mischiefe, because thou \add art\add* a bloody man.
\v 9 ¶ \x + \xo 16:9 \xt 1.Sam.24.15. chap.3.8.\x*Then said Abishai the sonne of Zeruiah vnto the king, Why should this dead dogge curse my lord the king? let mee goe ouer, I pray thee, and take off his head.
\v 10 And the king said, What haue I to doe with you, ye sonnes of Zeruiah? So let him curse, because the \nd LORD\nd* hath said vnto him, Curse Dauid. Who shall then say, Wherefore hast thou done so?
\v 11 And Dauid said to Abishai, and to all his seruants, Beholde, my sonne which came foorth of my bowels, seeketh my life: how much more now \add may this\add* Beniamite doe it? let him alone, and let him curse: for the \nd LORD\nd* hath bidden him.
\v 12 \f + \fr 16:12 \ft Or, teares, Hebr. eye.\f*It may bee that the \nd LORD\nd* will looke on mine affliction, and that the \nd LORD\nd* will requite good for his cursing this day.
\v 13 \f + \fr 16:13 \ft Hebr. dusted him with dust.\f*And as Dauid and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the hilles side ouer against him, and cursed as hee went, and threw stones at him, and cast dust.
\v 14 And the king, and all the people that \add were\add* with him, came weary, and refreshed themselues there.
\v 15 ¶ And Absalom and al the people the men of Israel, came to Ierusalem, and Ahithophel with him.
\v 16 \f + \fr 16:16 \ft Heb. let the king liue.\f*And it came to passe when Hushai the Archite, Dauids friend, was come vnto Absalom, that Hushai said vnto Absalom, God saue the king, God saue the king.
\v 17 And Absalom said to Hushai, \add Is\add* this thy kindnesse to thy friend? Why wentest thou not with thy friend?
\v 18 And Hushai said vnto Absalom, Nay, but whom the \nd LORD\nd* and this people, and all the men of Israel chuse, his will I bee, and with him will I abide.
\v 19 And againe, whom should I \add serue\add*? \add should I\add* not serue in the presence of his sonne? as I haue serued in thy fathers presence, so will I be in thy presence.
\v 20 ¶ Then said Absalom to Ahithophel, Giue counsell among you what we shall doe.
\v 21 And Ahithophel said vnto Absalom, Goe in vnto thy fathers concubines, which he hath left to keepe the house, and all Israel shall heare that thou art abhorred of thy father, then shall the hands of all that \add are\add* with thee be strong.
\v 22 So they spread Absalom a tent vpon the top of the house, and Absalom went in vnto his fathers concubines, in the sight of all Israel.
\v 23 \f + \fr 16:23 \ft Heb. word.\f*And the counsell of Ahithophel which he counselled in those dayes, \add was\add* as if a man had enquired at the Oracle of God: so \add was\add* all the counsell of Ahithophel, both with Dauid and with Absalom.
\c 17
\iex 1 Ahithophels counsell is ouerthrowen by Hushais, according to Gods appointment. 15 Secret intelligence is sent vnto Dauid. 23 Ahithophel hangeth himselfe. 25 Amasa is made captaine. 27 Dauid at Mahanaim is furnished with prouision.
\v 1 ¶ Moreouer Ahithophel said vnto Absalom, Let mee nowe chuse out twelue thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after Dauid this night.
\v 2 And I wil come vpon him while hee \add is\add* wearie and weake handed, and wil make him afraid: and all the people that \add are\add* with him shall flee, and I will smite the king onely.
\v 3 And I wil bring backe all the people vnto thee: the man whom thou seekest \add is\add* as if all returned: \add so\add* all the people shall be in peace.
\v 4 \f + \fr 17:4 \ft Hebr. was right in the eyes of &c.\f*And the saying pleased Absalom well, and all the Elders of Israel.
\v 5 \f + \fr 17:5 \ft Hebr. what is in his mouth.\f*Then said Absalom, Call now Hushai the Archite also, and let vs heare likewise what he saith.
\v 6 \f + \fr 17:6 \ft Heb. word.\f*And when Hushai was come to Absalom, Absalom spake vnto him, saying, Ahithophel hath spoken after this maner: shall we doe \add after\add* his saying? if not, speake thou.
\v 7 \f + \fr 17:7 \ft Heb. counselled.\f*And Hushai said vnto Absalom, The counsell that Ahithophel hath giuen, \add is\add* not good at this time.
\v 8 \f + \fr 17:8 \ft Heb. bitter of soule.\f*For, (said Hushai,) thou knowest thy father and his men, that they \add bee\add* mightie men, and they \add be\add* chafed in their minds, as a beare robbed of her whelps in the field: and thy father \add is\add* a man of warre, and will not lodge with the people.
\v 9 \f + \fr 17:9 \ft Heb. fallen.\f*Behold, he is hid now in some pit, or in some \add other\add* place: and it wil come to passe when some of them bee ouerthrowen at the first, that whosoeuer heareth it, wil say, There is a slaughter among the people that followe Absalom.
\v 10 And he also \add that is\add* valiant, whose heart \add is\add* as the heart of a Lyon, shall vtterly melt: for all Israel knoweth that thy father \add is\add* a mightie man, and \add they\add* which \add be\add* with him \add are\add* valiant men.
\v 11 \f + \fr 17:11 \ft Heb. that thy face or presence goe, &c.\f*Therefore I counsell, that all Israel be generally gathered vnto thee, from Dan euen to Beer-sheba, as the sand that \add is\add* by the sea for multitude, and that thou goe to battell in thine owne person.
\v 12 So shall wee come vpon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light vpon him as the dew falleth on the ground: and of him and of all the men that \add are\add* with him, there shall not be left so much as one.
\v 13 Moreouer, if hee be gotten into a citie, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the riuer, vntill there be not one small stone found there.
\v 14 \f + \fr 17:14 \ft Heb. commanded.\f*And Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsell of Hushai the Archite, \add is\add* better then the counsell of Ahithophel: For the \nd LORD\nd* had appointed to defeate the good counsell of Ahithophel, to the intent that the \nd LORD\nd* might bring euill vpon Absalom.
\v 15 ¶ Then said Hushai vnto Zadok and to Abiathar the Priestes, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsell Absalom and the Elders of Israel, and thus and thus haue I counselled.
\v 16 Now therefore send quickly, and tell Dauid, saying, Lodge not this night in the plaines of the wildernes, but speedily passe ouer, lest the King be swallowed vp, and all the people that \add are\add* with him.
\v 17 Now Ionathan and Ahimaaz stayed by En-rogel: (for they might not be seene to come into the citie) and a wench went and tolde them: and they went, and tolde king Dauid.
\v 18 Neuerthelesse, a ladde saw them, and tolde Absalom: but they went both of them away quickely, and came to a mans house in Bahurim, which had a Well in his court, whither they went downe.
\v 19 And the woman tooke and spread a couering ouer the welles mouth, and spread ground corne thereon; and the thing was not knowen.
\v 20 And when Absaloms seruants came to the woman to the house, they said, Where \add is\add* Ahimaaz and Ionathan? And the woman said vnto \add them\add*, They be gone ouer the brooke of water. And when they had sought, and could not finde them, they returned to Ierusalem.
\v 21 And it came to passe after they were departed, that they came vp out of the Well, and went and tolde king Dauid, and said vnto Dauid, Arise, and passe quickely ouer the water: for thus hath Ahithophel counselled against you.
\v 22 Then Dauid arose, and all the people that \add were\add* with him, and they passed ouer Iordane: by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone ouer Iordane.
\v 23 ¶ \f + \fr 17:23 \ft Heb. done.\f*\f + \fr 17:23 \ft Heb. gaue charge concerning his house.\f*And when Ahithophel sawe that his counsell was not followed, he sadled \add his\add* asse, and arose, and gate him home to his house, to his citie, and put his houshold in order, and hanged himselfe, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.
\v 24 Then Dauid came to Mahanaim: and Absalom passed ouer Iordane, he and all the men of Israel with him.
\v 25 ¶ And Absalom made Amasa captaine of the hoste in stead of Ioab: which Amasa \add was\add* a mans sonne whose name \add was\add* Ithra an Israelite, that went in to Abigal the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah Ioabs mother.
\v 26 So Israel and Absalom pitched in the land of Gilead.
\v 27 ¶ And it came to passe when Dauid was come to Mahanaim, that Shobi the sonne of Nahash of Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and Machir the sonne of Ammiel of Lodebar, and Barzillai the Gileadite, of Rogelim,
\v 28 \f + \fr 17:28 \ft Or, cups.\f*Brought beds, and basins, and earthen vessels, and wheat, and barley, and floure, and parched corne, & beanes, and lentiles, and parched \add pulse\add*,
\v 29 And honie, and butter, and sheepe, and cheese of kine for Dauid, and for the people that \add were\add* with him, to eate: for they said, The people \add is\add* hungrie, and wearie, and thirstie in the wildernesse.
\c 18
\iex 1 Dauid viewing the armies in their march, giueth them charge of Absalom. 6 The Israelites are sore smitten in the wood of Ephraim. 9 Absalom hanging in an Oke, is slaine by Ioab, and cast into a pit. 18 Absaloms place. 19 Ahimaaz and Cushi bring tidings to Dauid. 33 Dauid mourneth for Absalom.
\v 1 ¶ And Dauid numbred the people that \add were\add* with him, and set captaines of thousands, and captaines of hundreds ouer them.
\v 2 And Dauid sent forth a third part of the people vnder the hand of Ioab, and a third part vnder the hand of Abishai the sonne of Zeruiah Ioabs brother, and a third part vnder the hand of Ittai the Gittite: and the king said vnto the people, I will surely goe foorth with you my selfe also.
\v 3 \f + \fr 18:3 \ft Heb. set their heart on vs.\f*\f + \fr 18:3 \ft Heb. as ten thousand of vs.\f*\f + \fr 18:3 \ft Heb. be to succour.\f*But the people answered, Thou shalt not goe foorth: for if we flee away, they will not care for vs, neither if halfe of vs die will they care for vs: but now \add thou art\add* worth ten thousand of vs: therfore now \add it is\add* better that thou succour vs out of the citie.
\v 4 And the King sayde vnto them, What seemeth you best, I will doe. And the King stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by hundreds, and by thousands.
\v 5 And the king commanded Ioab, and Abishai, and Ittai, saying, Deale gently for my sake with the yong man, \add euen\add* with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gaue all the captaines charge concerning Absalom.
\v 6 ¶ So the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battell was in the wood of Ephraim,
\v 7 Where the people of Israel were slaine before the seruants of Dauid, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand \add men\add*.
\v 8 \f + \fr 18:8 \ft Hebr. multiplied to deuoure.\f*For the battell was there scattered ouer the face of all the countrey: and the wood deuoured more people that day, then the sword deuoured.
\v 9 ¶ And Absalom met the seruants of Dauid; and Absalom rode vpon a mule, and the mule went vnder the thicke boughs of a great Oke, and his head caught hold of the Oke, and hee was taken vp betweene the heauen and the earth, and the mule that \add was\add* vnder him, went away.
\v 10 And a certaine man saw \add it\add*, and told Ioab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an Oke.
\v 11 And Ioab said vnto the man that told him, And behold, thou sawest \add him\add*, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground, and I would haue giuen thee tenne \add shekels\add* of siluer, and a girdle?
\v 12 \f + \fr 18:12 \ft Heb. weigh vpon mine hand.\f*\f + \fr 18:12 \ft Hebr. beware whosoeuer ye be, of &c.\f*And the man saide vnto Ioab, Though I should receiue a thousand \add shekels\add* of siluer in mine hand, \add yet\add* would I not put foorth mine hand against the Kings sonne: for in our hearing the King charged thee, and Abishai, and Ittai, saying, Beware that none \add touch\add* the yong man Absalom.
\v 13 Otherwyse, I should haue wrought falshood against mine owne life: for there is no matter hid from the King, and thou thy selfe wouldest haue set thy selfe against \add me\add*.
\v 14 \f + \fr 18:14 \ft Hebr. before thee.\f*\f + \fr 18:14 \ft Heb. heart.\f*Then said Ioab, I may not tary thus with thee. And hee tooke three darts in his hand, and thrust them thorow the heart of Absalom, while hee \add was\add* yet aliue in the midst of the Oke.
\v 15 And ten yong men that bare Ioabs armour, compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.
\v 16 And Ioab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel: for Ioab helde backe the people.
\v 17 And they tooke Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and layd a very great heape of stones vpon him: and all Israel fled euery one to his tent.
\v 18 ¶ \x + \xo 18:18 \xt Gene.14.17.\x*Now Absalom in his life time had taken and reared vp for himselfe a pillar, which \add is\add* in the Kings dale: for hee said, I haue no sonne to keepe my name in remembrance: And hee called the pillar after his owne name, and it is called vnto this day, Absaloms place.
\v 19 ¶ \f + \fr 18:19 \ft Hebr. iudged him from the hand &c.\f*Then said Ahimaaz the sonne of Zadok, Let mee now runne, and beare the King tidings, how that the \nd LORD\nd* hath auenged him of his enemies.
\v 20 \f + \fr 18:20 \ft Hebr. be a man of tidings.\f*And Ioab said vnto him, Thou shalt not beare tidings this day, but thou shalt beare tidings another day: but this day thou shalt beare no tidings, because the Kings sonne is dead.
\v 21 Then said Ioab to Cushi, Goe tell the King what thou hast seene. And Cushi bowed himselfe vnto Ioab, and ranne.
\v 22 \f + \fr 18:22 \ft Hebr. be what may.\f*\f + \fr 18:22 \ft Or, conuenient.\f*Then said Ahimaaz the sonne of Zadok yet againe to Ioab, But howsoeuer, let mee, I pray thee, also runne after Cushi. And Ioab said, Wherefore wilt thou runne, my sonne, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready?
\v 23 But howsoeuer, (\add said he\add*) let mee runne: And hee said vnto him, Runne. Then Ahimaaz ranne by the way of the plaine, and ouerranne Cushi.
\v 24 And Dauid sate betweene the two gates: and the watchman went vp to the roofe ouer the gate vnto the wall, and lift vp his eyes, and looked, and behold, a man running alone.
\v 25 And the watchman cried, and told the King. And the king said, If he \add bee\add* alone, \add there is\add* tidings in his mouth. And he came apace, and drew neere.
\v 26 And the watchman saw another man running, and the watchman called vnto the porter, and said, Behold, \add another\add* man running alone. And the King said, He also bringeth tidings.
\v 27 \f + \fr 18:27 \ft Hebr. I see the running.\f*And the watchman said, Mee thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the sonne of Zadok. And the King said, Hee \add is\add* a good man, and commeth with good tidings.
\v 28 \f + \fr 18:28 \ft Or, peace be to thee. Hebr. peace\f*\f + \fr 18:28 \ft Heb. shut vp.\f*And Ahimaaz called, and said vnto the King, All is well. And hee fell downe to the earth vpon his face before the King, and saide, Blessed \add bee\add* the \nd LORD\nd* thy God which hath deliuered vp the men that lift vp their hande against my lord the King.
\v 29 \f + \fr 18:29 \ft Hebr. Is there peace?\f*And the king said, Is the yong man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered, When Ioab sent the kings seruant, and \add me\add* thy seruant, I saw a great tumult, but I knew not what \add it was\add*.
\v 30 And the king said \add vnto him\add*, Turne aside \add and\add* stand here. And hee turned aside, and stood still.

\v 5 And Ioab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy seruants, which this day haue saued thy life, and the liues of thy sonnes, & of thy daughters, and the liues of thy wiues, and the liues of thy concubines,

\v 23 Therfore the king said vnto Shimei, Thou shalt not die: and the King sware vnto him.

\iex 1 Dauid tempted by Satan, forceth Ioab to number the people. 5 The captaines in nine moneths and twentie dayes, bring the muster of eleuen thousand fighting men. 10 Dauid hauing three plagues propounded by Gad, repenteth, and chuseth the three dayes pestilence. 15 After the death of threescore and ten thousand, Dauid by repentance preuenteth the destruction of Ierusalem. 18 Dauid, by Gads direction purchaseth Araunahs threshing-floore, where hauing sacrificed, the plague staveth.
\v 1 ¶ \x + \xo 24:1 \xt Satan. See 1.Chron. 21.1.\x*And againe the anger of the \nd LORD\nd* was kindled against Israel, and hee mooued Dauid against them, to say, Goe, number Israel and Iudah.
\v 2 \f + \fr 24:2 \ft Or, compasse.\f*For the king said to Ioab the captaine of the hoste, which \add was\add* with him, Goe now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan euen to Beer-sheba, and number ye the people, that I may know the number of the people.
\v 3 And Ioab sayde vnto the King, Now the \nd LORD\nd* thy God adde vnto the people (how many soeuer they be) an hundred folde, and that the eyes of my lorde the king may see \add it\add*: but why doeth my lord the king delight in this thing?
\v 4 Notwithstanding, the kings word preuailed against Ioab, and against the captaines of the hoste: and Ioab and the captaines of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.
\v 5 ¶ \f + \fr 24:5 \ft Or, valley.\f*And they passed ouer Iordane, and pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the citie that \add lieth\add* in the midst of the riuer of Gad, and toward Iazer.

\v 8 So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Ierusalem at the ende of nine moneths, and twentie dayes.
\v 9 And Ioab gaue vp the summe of the number of the people vnto the king, and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drewe the sword: and the men of Iudah \add were\add* fiue hundred thousand men.
\v 10 ¶ And Dauids heart smote him, after that hee had numbred the people: and Dauid sayde vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, I haue sinned greatly in that I haue done: and nowe I beseech thee, O \nd LORD\nd*, take away the iniquitie of thy seruant, for I haue done very foolishly.
\v 11 For when Dauid was vp in the morning, the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came vnto the Prophet Gad Dauids Seer, saying,
\v 12 Goe and say vnto Dauid, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, I offer thee three \add things\add*; chuse thee one of them, that I may doe it vnto thee.
\v 13 So Gad came to Dauid, and told him, and said vnto him, Shall seuen yeeres of famine come vnto thee in thy land? or wilt thou flee three moneths before thine enemies, while they pursue thee? or that there be three dayes pestilence in thy land? Now aduise, and see what answere I shall returne to him that sent me.
\v 14 \f + \fr 24:14 \ft Or, many.\f*And Dauid saide vnto Gad, I am in a great strait: let vs fall now into the hand of the \nd LORD\nd* (for his mercies \add are\add* great,) and let me not fall into the hand of man.
\v 15 ¶ So the \nd LORD\nd* sent a pestilence vpon Israel, from the morning, euen to the time appointed: and there died of the people from Dan euen to Beersheba, seuentie thousand men.
\v 16 \x + \xo 24:16 \xt 1.Sam. 15.11.\x*And when the Angel stretched out his hand vpon Ierusalem to destroy it, the \nd LORD\nd* repented him of the euill, and said to the Angel that destroyed the people, It is ynough: stay now thine hand. And the Angel of the \nd LORD\nd* was by the threshing place of Araunah the Iebusite.
\v 17 And Dauid spake vnto the \nd LORD\nd* when he saw the Angel that smote the people, and said, Loe, I haue sinned, and I haue done wickedly: but these sheepe, what haue they done? Let thine hand, I pray thee, be against mee, and against my fathers house.
\v 18 ¶ And Gad came that day to Dauid, and said vnto him, Goe vp, reare an Altar vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, in the threshing floore of Araunah the Iebusite.
\v 19 And Dauid, according to the saying of Gad, went vp, as the \nd LORD\nd* commanded.
\v 20 And Araunah looked, and saw the King and his seruants comming on toward him: and Araunah went out, and bowed himselfe before the King on his face vpon the ground.
\v 21 And Araunah said, Wherefore is my lord the King come to his seruant? and Dauid saide, To buy the threshing floore of thee, to build an Altar vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, that the plague may be stayed from the people.
\v 22 And Araunah said vnto Dauid, Let my lord the King take and offer vp what \add seemeth\add* good vnto him: Beholde, \add here be\add* oxen for burnt sacrifice, and threshing instruments, and \add other\add* instruments of the oxen for wood.
\v 23 All these \add things\add* did Araunah, \add as\add* a king, giue vnto the King: and Araunah saide vnto the King, The \nd LORD\nd* thy God accept thee.
\v 24 And the King said vnto Araunah, Nay, but I will surely buy \add it\add* of thee at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings vnto the \nd LORD\nd* my God, of that which doeth cost mee nothing. So Dauid bought the threshing floore, and the oxen, for fiftie shekels of siluer.
\v 25 Aud Dauid built there an Altar vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, and offered burnt offerings, and peace offerings: so the \nd LORD\nd* was intreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.
