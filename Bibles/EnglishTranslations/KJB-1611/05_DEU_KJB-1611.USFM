\iex 1 Moses speech in the end of the fortieth yeere, briefly rehearsing the story, 6 of Gods promise, 9 of giuing them officers, 19 of sending the spies to search the land, 34 of Gods anger for their incredulitie, 41 and disobedience.
\v 1 ¶ These \add bee\add* the woordes which Moses spake vnto all Israel, on this side Iordane in the wildernes, in the plaine ouer against \f + \fr 1:1 \ft Or, Zuph.\f*the Red \add sea\add*, betweene Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
\v 2 (\add There are\add* eleuen daies iourney from Horeb, by the way of mount Seir, vnto Kadesh Barnea.)
\v 3 And it came to passe in the fourtieth yeere, in the eleuenth moneth, on the first \add day\add* of the moneth, \add that\add* Moses spake vnto the children of Israel, according vnto all that the \nd LORD\nd* had giuen him in commandement vnto them:
\v 4 \x + \xo 1:4 \xt Num.21. 24.\x*After hee had slaine Sihon the King of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the King of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth, in Edrei.
\v 5 On this side Iordane, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,
\v 6 The \nd LORD\nd* our God spake vnto vs in Horeb, saying, Ye haue dwelt long ynough in this mount:
\v 7 Turne you, and take your iourney, and goe to the mount of the Amorites, and vnto \f + \fr 1:7 \ft Hebr. all his neighbours.\f*all \add the places\add* nigh thereunto, in the plaine, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the South, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and vnto Lebanon, vnto the great riuer, the riuer Euphrates.
\v 8 Behold, I haue \f + \fr 1:8 \ft Hebr. giuen.\f*set the land before you: Goe in, and possesse the land, which the \nd LORD\nd* sware vnto your fathers, \x + \xo 1:8 \xt Gene. 15. 18.and 17. 7, 8.\x*Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, to giue vnto them, and to their seed after them.
\v 9 ¶ And I spake vnto you at that time, saying, I am not able to beare you my selfe alone:
\v 10 The \nd LORD\nd* your God hath multiplied you, and beholde, you \add are\add* this day as the starres of heauen for multitude.
\v 11 (The \nd LORD\nd* God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many moe as ye \add are\add*, and blesse you as he hath promised you.)
\v 12 How can I my selfe alone beare your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?
\v 13 \f + \fr 1:13 \ft Heb. giue.\f*Take ye wise men, and vnderstanding, and knowen among your tribes, and I will make them rulers ouer you.
\v 14 And ye answered me, and saide, The thing which thou hast spoken, \add is\add* good for vs to doe.
\v 15 So I tooke the chiefe of your tribes, wise men, and knowen, and \f + \fr 1:15 \ft Heb. gaue.\f*made them heads ouer you, captaines ouer thousands, and captaines ouer hundreds, and captaines ouer fifties, and captaines ouer tennes, and officers among your tribes.
\v 16 And I charged your Iudges at that time, saying, Heare \add the causes\add* betweene your brethren, and \x + \xo 1:16 \xt Ioh.7.24.\x*iudge righteously betweene \add euery\add* man and his brother, & the stranger \add that is\add* with him.
\v 17 \x + \xo 1:17 \xt Leuit.19. 15.chap.16 19. 1.sam. 16.7. pro. 24.23.\x*Ye shall not \f + \fr 1:17 \ft Hebr. acknowledge faces.\f*respect persons in iudgement, \add but\add* you shall heare the small aswell as the great: you shall not bee afraid of the face of man, for the iudgment \add is\add* Gods: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring \add it\add* vnto me, and I will heare it.
\v 18 And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should doe.
\v 19 ¶ And when wee departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wildernes, which you saw by the way of the mountaine of the Amorites, as the \nd LORD\nd* our God commanded vs: and wee came to Kadesh Barnea.
\v 20 And I said vnto you, Ye are come vnto the mountaine of the Amorites, which the \nd LORD\nd* our God doth giue vnto vs.
\v 21 Behold, the \nd LORD\nd* thy God hath set the land before thee: Goe vp, \add and\add* possesse \add it\add*, as the \nd LORD\nd* God of thy fathers hath said vnto thee: Feare not, neither be discouraged.
\v 22 ¶ And ye came neere vnto mee euery one of you, and said, We will send men before vs, and they shall search vs out the land, and bring vs word againe, by what way we must goe vp, and into what cities we shall come.
\v 23 And the saying pleased mee well: and \x + \xo 1:23 \xt Num.13. 3.\x*I tooke twelue men of you, one of a tribe.
\v 24 And \x + \xo 1:24 \xt Num.13. 24.\x*they turned and went vp into the mountaine, and came vnto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.
\v 25 And they tooke of the fruit of the land in their handes, and brought \add it\add* downe vnto vs, and brought vs worde againe, and said, \add It is\add* a good lande which the \nd LORD\nd* our God doeth giue vs.
\v 26 Notwithstanding, ye would not goe vp, but rebelled against the commandement of the \nd LORD\nd* your God.
\v 27 And ye murmured in your tents and said, Because the \nd LORD\nd* hated vs, he hath brought vs forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliuer vs into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy vs:
\v 28 Whither shall wee goe vp? our brethren haue \f + \fr 1:28 \ft Heb. melted.\f*discouraged our heart, saying, The people \add is\add* greater and taller then we, the cities \add are\add* great, and walled vp to heauen, and moreouer we haue seene the sonnes of the \x + \xo 1:28 \xt Num. 13. 29.\x*Anakims there.
\v 29 Then I said vnto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.
\v 30 The \nd LORD\nd* your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that hee did for you in Egypt before your eyes:
\v 31 And in the wildernes, where thou hast seene how that the \nd LORD\nd* thy God bare thee, as a man doth beare his sonne, in all the way that ye went, vntil ye came into this place.
\v 32 Yet in this thing ye did not beleeue the \nd LORD\nd* your God,
\v 33 \x + \xo 1:33 \xt Exod.13. 21.\x*Who went in the way before you to search you out a place to pitch your tents \add in\add*, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should goe, and in a cloud by day.
\v 34 And the \nd LORD\nd* heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,
\v 35 \x + \xo 1:35 \xt Num.14. 29.\x*Surely there shall not one of these men of this euill generation see that good land, which I sware to giue vnto your fathers:
\v 36 Saue Caleb the sonne of Iephunneh, he shall see it, and to him will I giue the land that he hath troden vpon, and to his children, because hee hath \f + \fr 1:36 \ft Heb. fulfilled to goe after.\f*wholly followed the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 37 \x + \xo 1:37 \xt Num. 20. 12. and 27. 14.\x*Also the \nd LORD\nd* was angry with me for your sakes, saying, \x + \xo 1:37 \xt Chap. 3. 26. and 4. 21. and 34. 4.\x*Thou also shalt not goe in thither.
\v 38 \add But\add* Ioshua the sonne of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall goe in thither. Encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherite it.
\v 39 Moreouer, your litle ones, which ye said should be a pray, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge betweene good and euil, they shall goe in thither; and vnto them will I giue it, and they shall possesse it.
\v 40 But \add as for\add* you, turne ye, and take your iourney into the wildernesse, by the way of the Red sea.
\v 41 Then ye answered, and said vnto mee, \x + \xo 1:41 \xt Num. 14. 40.\x*Wee haue sinned against the \nd LORD\nd*, we will goe vp and fight, according to all that the \nd LORD\nd* our God commanded vs. And when ye had girded on euery man his weapons of warre, yee were ready to goe vp into the hill.
\v 42 And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto me, Say vnto them, Goe not vp, neither fight, for I \add am\add* not among you: least ye be smitten before your enemies.
\v 43 So I spake vnto you, and you would not heare, but rebelled against the commandement of the \nd LORD\nd*, and \f + \fr 1:43 \ft Heb. you were presumptuous and went vp.\f*went presumptuously vp into the hill.
\v 44 And the Amorites which dwelt in that mountaine, came out against you, and chased you, as Bees doe, and destroyed you in Seir, \add euen\add* vnto Hormah.
\v 45 And ye returned and wept before the \nd LORD\nd*; but the \nd LORD\nd* would not hearken to your voyce, nor giue eare vnto you.
\v 46 So yee abode in Kadesh many dayes, according vnto the dayes that ye abode \add there\add*.

\iex 1 The story is continued, that they were not to meddle with the Edomites, 9 nor with the Moabites, 17 nor with the Ammonites, 24 but Sihon the Amorite was subdued by them.
\v 1 ¶ Then we turned, and tooke our iourney into the wildernesse, by the way of the Red sea, as the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto mee: and wee compassed mount Seir many dayes.
\v 2 And the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto me, saying,
\v 3 Yee haue compassed this mountaine long enough: turne you Northward.
\v 4 And commaund thou the people, saying, Ye \add are\add* to passe through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir, and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed vnto your selues therefore.
\v 5 Meddle not with them, for I will not giue you of their land, \f + \fr 2:5 \ft Hebr. euen to the treading of the sole of the foote.\f*no not so much as a foote breadth, \x + \xo 2:5 \xt Gene. 36. 8.\x*because I haue giuen mount Seir vnto Esau \add for\add* a possession.
\v 6 Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat, and yee shall also buy water of them for money, that yee may drinke.
\v 7 For the \nd LORD\nd* thy God hath blessed thee, in all the workes of thy hand: hee knoweth thy walking thorow this great wildernesse: these fourtie yeres the \nd LORD\nd* thy God hath bene with thee, thou hast lacked nothing.
\v 8 And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, thorow the way of the plaine from Elath, and from Ezion-Gaber, wee turned and passed by the way of the wildernesse of Moab.
\v 9 And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto mee, \f + \fr 2:9 \ft Or, vse no hostilitie against Moab.\f*Distresse not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battell: for I wil not giue thee of their land \add for\add* a possession, because I haue giuen Ar vnto the children of Lot \add for\add* a possession.
\v 10 The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims:
\v 11 Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims, but the Moabites call them Emims.
\v 12 \x + \xo 2:12 \xt Gen. 36. 20.\x*The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime, but the children of Esau \f + \fr 2:12 \ft Hebr. inherited them.\f*succeeded them when they had destroyed them from before them, & dwelt in their \f + \fr 2:12 \ft Or, roome.\f*stead, as Israel did vnto the land of his possession, which the \nd LORD\nd* gaue vnto them.
\v 13 Now rise vp, \add said I\add*, and get you ouer \x + \xo 2:13 \xt Num. 21. 12.\x*the \f + \fr 2:13 \ft Or, valley.\f*brooke Zered: and we went ouer the brooke Zered.
\v 14 And the space in which we came from Kadesh Barnea, vntill we were come ouer the brooke Zered, \add was\add* thirtie and eight yeeres; vntill all the generation of the men of warre were wasted out from among the hoste, as the \nd LORD\nd* sware vnto them.
\v 15 For indeed the hand of the \nd LORD\nd* was against them, to destroy them from among the hoste, vntill they were consumed.
\v 16 ¶ So it came to passe, when all the men of warre were consumed and dead from among the people,
\v 17 That the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto me, saying,
\v 18 Thou art to passe ouer thorow Ar, the coast of Moab, this day.
\v 19 And \add when\add* thou commest nigh ouer against the children of Ammon, distresse them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not giue thee of the lande of the children of Ammon \add any\add* possession, because I haue giuen it vnto the children of Lot \add for\add* a possession:
\v 20 (That also was accounted a land of Giants: giants dwelt therein in old time, and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims.
\v 21 A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims: but the \nd LORD\nd* destroyed them before them, and they succeeded them & dwelt in their stead:)
\v 22 As he did to the children of Esau which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them, and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead euen vnto this day.
\v 23 And the Auims which dwelt in Hazerim, \add euen\add* vnto Azzah, the Caphtorims which came foorth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.
\v 24 ¶ \f + \fr 2:24 \ft Heb. begin, possesse.\f*Rise ye vp, take your iourney, and passe ouer the riuer Arnon: Behold, I haue giuen into thy hand Sihon the Amorite king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possesse \add it\add*, and contend with him in battell.
\v 25 This day will I begin to put the dread of thee, and the feare of thee vpon the nations, \add that are\add* vnder the whole heauen, who shall heare report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.
\v 26 ¶ And I sent messengers out of the wildernesse of Kedemoth, vnto Sihon king of Heshbon, with wordes of peace, saying,
\v 27 \x + \xo 2:27 \xt Num. 21. 21, 22.\x*Let me passe through thy land: I will goe along by the high way, I will neither turne vnto the right hand, nor to the left.
\v 28 Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eate, and giue me water for money that I may drinke: Only I will passe through on my feet:
\v 29 As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did vnto me, vntill I shall passe ouer Iordan, into the land which the \nd LORD\nd* our God giueth vs.
\v 30 But Sihon King of Heshbon would not let vs passe by him: for the \nd LORD\nd* thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that hee might deliuer him into thy hand, as \add appeareth\add* this day.
\v 31 And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto mee, Behold, I haue begun to giue Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possesse, that thou mayest inherit his land.
\v 32 \x + \xo 2:32 \xt Num. 21. 23.\x*Then Sihon came out against vs, he & all his people to fight at Iahaz.
\v 33 And the \nd LORD\nd* our God deliuered him before vs, and wee smote him, and his sonnes, and all his people.
\v 34 \f + \fr 2:34 \ft Heb. euery citie of men and women and litle ones.\f*And we tooke all his cities at that time, and vtterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the litle ones of euery citie, we left none to remaine:
\v 35 Onely the cattell wee tooke for a pray vnto our selues, and the spoyle of the cities, which we tooke:
\v 36 From Aroer, which \add is\add* by the brinke of the riuer of Arnon, and \add from\add* the citie that \add is\add* by the riuer euen vnto Gilead, there was not one citie too strong for vs: the \nd LORD\nd* our God deliuered all vnto vs.
\v 37 Onely vnto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, \add nor\add* vnto any place of the riuer Iabbok, nor vnto the cities in the mountaines, nor vnto whatsoeuer the \nd LORD\nd* our God forbade vs.

\iex 1 The story of the conquest of Og king of Bashan. 11 The bignes of his bed. 12 The distribution of those lands to the two tribes and halfe. 23 Moses prayer to enter into the land. 26 He is permitted to see it.
\v 1 ¶ \x + \xo 3:1 \xt Num. 21. 33, &c. cha. 29.7.\x*Then we turned, and went vp the way to Bashan: and Og the King of Bashan came out against vs, hee, and all his people to battell at Edrei.
\v 2 \x + \xo 3:2 \xt Num. 21. 24.\x*And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto mee, Feare him not: for I will deliuer him, and all his people, and his land into thy hand, and thou shalt doe vnto him as thou didst vnto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.
\v 3 \x + \xo 3:3 \xt Num. 21. 33.\x*So the \nd LORD\nd* our God deliuered into our hands Og also the King of Bashan, and all his people: and wee smote him vntill none was left to him remayning.
\v 4 And we tooke all his cities at that time, there was not a citie which wee tooke not from them; threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdome of Og in Bashan.
\v 5 All these cities \add were\add* fenced with high walles, gates and barres, beside vnwalled townes a great many.
\v 6 And we vtterly destroyed them, as we did vnto Sihon King of Heshbon, vtterly destroying the men, women, and children of euery citie.
\v 7 But all the cattell, and the spoile of the cities, we tooke for a pray to our selues.
\v 8 And we tooke at that time out of the hand of the two Kings of the Amorites, the land that \add was\add* on this side Iordan, from the riuer of Arnon, vnto mount Hermon:
\v 9 (\add Which\add* Hermon the Sidonians call Syrion: and the Amorites call it Shenir.)
\v 10 All the cities of the plaine, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, vnto Salchah, and Edrei, cities of the kingdome of Og in Bashan.
\v 11 For onely Og King of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedsted \add was\add* a bedsted of yron: \add is\add* it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? Nine cubites \add was\add* the length thereof, and foure cubites the breadth of it, after the cubite of a man.
\v 12 \x + \xo 3:12 \xt Num. 32. 33. iosh. 13. 8. &c.\x*And this land \add which\add* we possessed at that time, from Aroer which \add is\add* by the riuer Arnon, and halfe mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gaue I vnto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites.
\v 13 And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, \add being\add* the kingdome of Og, gaue I vnto the halfe tribe of Manasseh: All the region of Argob with all Bashan, which was called the land of Giants.
\v 14 \x + \xo 3:14 \xt Num. 32. 41.\x*Iair the sonne of Manasseh tooke all the countrey of Argob, vnto the coastes of Geshuri, and Maachathi; and called them after his owne name, Bashan Hauoth Iair, vnto this day.
\v 15 And I gaue Gilead vnto Machir.
\v 16 And vnto the Reubenites, and vnto the Gadites, I gaue from Gilead, euen vnto the riuer Arnon, halfe the valley, and the border, euen vnto the riuer Iabbok, \add which is\add* the border of the children of Ammon:
\v 17 \f + \fr 3:17 \ft Or, vnder the springs of Pisgah, or the hill.\f*The plaine also, and Iordan, and the coast \add thereof\add*, from Chinnereth, \add euen\add* vnto the sea of the plaine, euen the salt sea, vnder Ashdoth Pisgah Eastward.
\v 18 ¶ \x + \xo 3:18 \xt Num. 32. 20.\x*\f + \fr 3:18 \ft Heb. sonnes of power.\f*And I commanded you at that time, saying, The \nd LORD\nd* your God hath giuen you this land to possesse it: ye shall passe ouer armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all \add that are\add* meet for the warre.
\v 19 But your wiues, and your little ones, and your cattell (\add for\add* I know that ye haue much cattel) shall abide in your cities, which I haue giuen you:
\v 20 \x + \xo 3:20 \xt Iosh. 22. 4.\x*Untill the \nd LORD\nd* haue giuen rest vnto your brethren, as well as vnto you, and vntill they also possesse the land which the \nd LORD\nd* your God hath giuen them beyond Iordan: and \add then\add* shall ye returne euery man vnto his possession, which I haue giuen you.
\v 21 ¶ \x + \xo 3:21 \xt Num. 27. 18.\x*And I commanded Ioshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes haue seene all that the \nd LORD\nd* your God hath done vnto these two Kings: so shal the \nd LORD\nd* doe vnto all the kingdomes whither thou passest.
\v 22 Ye shall not feare them: for the \nd LORD\nd* your God, he shal fight for you.
\v 23 And I besought the \nd LORD\nd* at that time, saying,
\v 24 O \nd LORD\nd* God, thou hast begun to shew thy seruant thy greatnesse, and thy mighty hand: for what God \add is there\add* in heauen, or in earth, that can do according to thy workes, and according to thy might?
\v 25 I pray thee let me goe ouer, and see the good land that \add is\add* beyond Iordan, that goodly mountaine and Lebanon.
\v 26 \x + \xo 3:26 \xt Num. 20. 12. chap. 1. 37.\x*But the \nd LORD\nd* was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not heare mee: and the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto me, Let it suffice thee, speake no more vnto me of this matter.
\v 27 \f + \fr 3:27 \ft Or, the hill.\f*Get thee vp into the top of Pisgah, and lift vp thine eyes Westward, and Northward, and Southward, and Eastward, and beholde \add it\add* with thine eyes: for thou shalt not goe ouer this Iordan.
\v 28 But charge Ioshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for hee shall goe ouer before this people, and he shall cause them to inherite the land which thou shalt see.
\v 29 So we abode in the valley, ouer against Beth-Peor.

\iex 1 An Exhortation to obedience. 41 Moses appointeth the three Cities of refuge on that side Iordan.
\v 1 ¶ Nowe therefore hearken, O Israel, vnto the Statutes, and vnto the Iudgments which I teach you, for to do \add them\add*, that ye may liue, and goe in and possesse the lande, which the \nd LORD\nd* God of your fathers giueth you.
\v 2 \x + \xo 4:2 \xt Chap. 12. 32. iosh. 1.7 pro.30.6. reu.22.18.\x*Ye shall not adde vnto the word which I command you, neither shall you diminish \add ought\add* from it, that ye may keepe the Commaundements of the \nd LORD\nd* your God, which I command you.
\v 3 \x + \xo 4:3 \xt Num. 25. 4 &c.\x*Your eyes haue seene what the \nd LORD\nd* did because of Baal Peor: for all the men that followed Baal Peor, the \nd LORD\nd* thy God hath destroyed them from among you.
\v 4 But yee that did cleaue vnto the \nd LORD\nd* your God, \add are\add* aliue euery one of you this day.
\v 5 Behold, I haue taught you Statutes, and Iudgements, euen as the \nd LORD\nd* my God commanded me, that ye should do so, in the land whither ye goe to possesse it.
\v 6 Keepe therefore, and doe \add them\add*; for this \add is\add* your wisedome and your vnderstanding in the sight of the nations, which shall heare all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation \add is\add* a wise and vnderstanding people.
\v 7 For what nation \add is there so\add* great, who \add hath\add* God \add so\add* nigh vnto them, as the \nd LORD\nd* our God \add is\add* in all things, that we call vpon him \add for\add*?
\v 8 And what nation \add is there so\add* great, that hath Statutes and Iudgements \add so\add* righteous, as all this Law which I set before you this day?
\v 9 Onely take heed to thy selfe, and keepe thy soule diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes haue seene, and lest they depart from thy heart all the dayes of thy life: but teach them thy sonnes, & thy sonnes sonnes:
\v 10 \add Specially\add*, the day \add that\add* thou stoodst before the \nd LORD\nd* thy God in Horeb, when the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto mee, Gather me the people together, and I will make them heare my wordes, that they may learne to feare mee all the dayes that they shall liue vpon the earth, and that they may teach their children.
\v 11 \x + \xo 4:11 \xt Exod.19. 18.\x*\f + \fr 4:11 \ft Heb. heart.\f*And ye came neere and stood vnder the mountaine, and the mountaine burnt with fire vnto the midst of heauen, with darkenes, cloudes, and thicke darkenesse.

\v 13 And he declared vnto you his couenant, which he commanded you to performe, euen ten cōmandements, and he wrote them vpon two tables of stone.
\v 14 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* commanded me at that time, to teach you Statutes, and Iudgements, that yee might doe them in the land whither ye goe ouer to possesse it.
\v 15 Take ye therfore good heed vnto your selues, (for ye saw no maner of similitude on the day \add that\add* the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto you in Horeb, out of the midst of the fire)
\v 16 Lest yee corrupt your selues, and make you a grauen image, the similitude of any figure, the likenes of male, or female,

\v 18 And I fell downe before the \nd LORD\nd*, as at the first, fortie dayes and fortie nights, I did neither eate bread nor drinke water, because of all your sinnes which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, to prouoke him to anger.

\v 20 And the \nd LORD\nd* was very angry with Aaron, to haue destroyed him: And I prayed for Aaron also the same time.
