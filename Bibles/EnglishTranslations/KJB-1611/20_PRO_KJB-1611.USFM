\v 8 My sonne, heare the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother.
\v 9 For they \add shall be\add* \f + \fr 1:9 \ft Hebr. an adding.\f*an ornament of grace vnto thy head, and chaines about thy necke.
\v 10 ¶ My sonne, if sinners entise thee, consent thou not.
\v 11 If they say, Come with vs, let vs lay wait for blood, let vs lurke priuily for the innocent without cause:
\v 12 Let vs swallow them vp aliue, as the graue, and whole, as those that goe downe into the pit:
\v 13 Wee shall finde all precious substance, wee shall fill our houses with spoile:
\v 14 Cast in thy lot among vs, let vs all haue one purse:
\v 15 My sonne, walke not thou in the way with them; refraine thy foot from their path:
\v 16 \f + \fr 1:16 \ft Isa.59.7. rom.3. 15.\f*For their feete runne to euil, and make haste to shed blood.
\v 17 Surely in vaine the net is spread \f + \fr 1:17 \ft Hebr. in the eyes of euery thing that hath a wing.\f*in the sight of any bird.
\v 18 And they lay wait for their \add owne\add* blood, they lurke priuily for their \add owne\add* liues.
\v 19 So \add are\add* the waies of euery one that is greedie of gaine: \add which\add* taketh away the life of the owners thereof.
\v 20 ¶ \f + \fr 1:20 \ft Hebr. wisedomes, that is, excellent wisedome.\f*Wisedome crieth without, she \f + \fr 1:20 \ft Prou.8. 1.\f*vttereth her voice in the streets:
\v 21 Shee crieth in the chiefe place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she vttereth her words, \add saying\add*,
\v 22 How long, ye simple ones, will ye loue simplicitie? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fooles hate knowledge?
\v 23 Turne you at my reproofe: behold, I will powre out my spirit vnto you, I will make knowen my wordes vnto you.
\v 24 ¶ \f + \fr 1:24 \ft Isa.65.12. and 66.4. ier.7.13. ezech.8.18\f*Because I haue called, and yee refused, I haue stretched out my hand, and no man regarded:
\v 25 But ye haue set at nought all my counsell, & would none of my reproofe:
\v 26 I also will laugh at your calamitie, I wil mocke when your feare commeth.
\v 27 \f + \fr 1:27 \ft Iob.27. 9 isa. 1. 15. ier.11.11. & 14. 12.\f*When your feare commeth as desolation, and your destruction commeth as a whirlewinde; when distresse and anguish commeth vpon you:
\v 28 \f + \fr 1:28 \ft Micah.3.4\f*Then shall they call vpon mee, but I will not answere; they shall seeke me early, but they shall not finde me:
\v 29 For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the feare of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 30 They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproofe.
\v 31 Therefore shall they eate of the fruite of their owne way, and be filled with their owne deuices.
\v 32 For the \f + \fr 1:32 \ft Or, ease of the simple.\f*turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fooles shall destroy them.
\v 33 But who so hearkneth vnto mee, shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from feare of euill.

\v 13 Who leaue the pathes of vprightnesse, to walke in the wayes of darkenesse:
\v 14 Who reioyce to doe euill, \add and\add* delight in the frowardnesse of the wicked.
\v 15 Whose wayes \add are\add* crooked, and \add they\add* froward in their pathes.

\v 17 Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the couenant of her God.
\v 18 For her house inclineth vnto death, and her pathes vnto the dead:
\v 19 None that goe vnto her, returne againe, neither take they hold of the pathes of life.
\v 20 That thou mayest walke in the way of good \add men\add*, and keepe the pathes of the righteous.
\v 21 \f + \fr 2:21 \ft Psal.37. 30.\f*For the vpright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remaine in it.
\v 22 \f + \fr 2:22 \ft Iob.18. 17. psal. 104.35.\f*But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressours shalbe \f + \fr 2:22 \ft Or, pluckt vp.\f*rooted out of it.
