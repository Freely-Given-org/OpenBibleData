\iex 1 Isaiah complaineth of Iudah for her rebellion. 5 He lamenteth her iudgements. 10 He vpbraideth their whole seruice. 16 He exhorteth to repentance, with promises and threatnings. 21 Bewailing their wickednesse, hee denounceth Gods iudgements. 25 Hee promiseth grace, 28 and threatneth destruction to the wicked.
\v 1 ¶ The Uision of Isaiah the sonne of Amoz, which hee sawe concerning Iudah and Ierusalem, in the dayes of Uzziah, Iotham, Ahaz, & Hezekiah kings of Iudah.

\v 4 Ah sinnefull nation, a people \f + \fr 1:4 \ft Heb. of heauinesse.\f*laden with iniquitie, a seede of euill doers, children that are corrupters: they haue forsaken the \nd LORD\nd*, they haue prouoked the Holy one of Israel vnto anger, they are \f + \fr 1:4 \ft Heb. alienated, or separated.\f*gone away backward.
\v 5 ¶ Why should yee be stricken any more? yee will \f + \fr 1:5 \ft Heb. increase reuolt.\f*reuolt more and more: the whole head is sicke, and the whole heart faint.
\v 6 From the sole of the foote, euen vnto the head, \add there is\add* no soundnesse in it; \add but\add* wounds, and bruises, and putrifying sores: they haue not beene closed, neither bound vp, neither mollified with \f + \fr 1:6 \ft Or, oyle.\f*oyntment.
\v 7 Your countrey \add is\add* \x + \xo 1:7 \xt Chap.5.5. deut. 28. 51, 52.\x*desolate, your cities \add are\add* burnt with fire: your land, strangers deuoure it in your presence, and \add it is\add* desolate \f + \fr 1:7 \ft Heb. as the ouerthrow of strangers.\f*as ouerthrowen by strangers.
\v 8 And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged citie.
\v 9 Except the \nd LORD\nd* of hostes had \x + \xo 1:9 \xt Lam.3.22 rom. 9.29.\x*left vnto vs a very small remnant, we should haue beene as \x + \xo 1:9 \xt Gen. 19. 24.\x*Sodom, \add and\add* we should haue bene like vnto Gomorrah.

\v 12 When ye come to \f + \fr 1:12 \ft Heb. to be seene.\f*appeare before mee, who hath required this at your hand, to tread my courts?
\v 13 Bring no more vaine oblations, incense is an abomination vnto me: the new Moones, and Sabbaths, the calling of assemblies I cannot away with; \add it is\add* \f + \fr 1:13 \ft Or, griefe.\f*iniquitie, euen the solemne meeting.
\v 14 Your new Moones, and your appointed Feasts my soule hateth: they are a trouble vnto me, I am weary to beare \add them\add*.
\v 15 And when ye spread foorth your \x + \xo 1:15 \xt Prou. 1. 28. iere.14 12. mic. 3.4.\x*handes, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when yee \f + \fr 1:15 \ft Heb. multiply prayer.\f*make many prayers I will not heare: your hands are full of \x + \xo 1:15 \xt Cha. 59.3.\x*\f + \fr 1:15 \ft Heb. bloods\f*blood.
\v 16 ¶ Wash yee, make you cleane, put away the euill of your doings from before mine eyes, \x + \xo 1:16 \xt 1.Pet.3. 11.\x*cease to doe euill,
\v 17 Learne to doe well, seeke iudgement, \f + \fr 1:17 \ft Or, righten.\f*relieue the oppressed, iudge the fatherlesse, plead for the widow.
\v 18 Come now and let vs reason together, saith the \nd LORD\nd*: though your sinnes be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimsin, they shall be as wooll.

\v 20 But if yee refuse and rebell, yee shalbe deuoured with the sword: for the mouth of the \nd LORD\nd* hath spoken \add it\add*.
\v 21 ¶ Howe is the faithfull citie become an harlot? it was full of iudgement, righteousnesse lodged in it; but now murtherers.
\v 22 Thy siluer is become drosse, thy wine mixt with water.
\v 23 Thy princes \add are\add* rebellious and companions of theeues: euery one loueth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they \x + \xo 1:23 \xt Ier. 5.28. Zac.7.10.\x*iudge not the fatherlesse, neither doth the cause of the widowe come vnto them.
\v 24 Therefore, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, the \nd LORD\nd* of hostes, the mighty one of Israel; Ah, I will ease me of mine aduersaries, and auenge me of mine enemies.
\v 25 ¶ And I will turne my hand vpon thee, and \f + \fr 1:25 \ft Heb. according to purenesse.\f*purely purge away thy drosse, and take away all thy tinne.
\v 26 And I will restore thy iudges as at the first, and thy counsellers as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called the citie of righteousnesse, the faithfull citie.
\v 27 Zion shall be redeemed with iudgement, and \f + \fr 1:27 \ft Or, they that returne of her.\f*her conuerts with righteousnesse.
\v 28 ¶ And the \x + \xo 1:28 \xt Iob. 31.3. psal. 1.6. & 5.6. & 73. 27. & 92. 10. & 104. 35.\x*\f + \fr 1:28 \ft Heb. breaking.\f*destruction of the transgressours and of the sinners \add shall be\add* together: and they that forsake the \nd LORD\nd* shall be consumed.
\v 29 For they shall be ashamed of the okes which yee haue desired, and yee shalbe confounded for the gardens that yee haue chosen.
\v 30 For yee shall be as an oke whose leafe fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.
\v 31 And the strong shall be as towe, \f + \fr 1:31 \ft Or, and his worke.\f*and the maker of it as a sparke, and they shall both burne together, and none shall quench \add them\add*.

\v 15 Neither shall there be \add any\add* worke for Egypt, which the head or taile, branch or rush may doe.
\v 16 In that day shall Egypt bee like vnto women: and it shall be afraid and feare, because of the shaking of the hand of the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, which he shaketh ouer it.
\v 17 And the land of Iudah shall bee a terrour vnto Egypt, euery one that maketh mention thereof, shal be afraid in himselfe, because of the counsell of the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, which he hath determined against it.

\v 20 And it shall be for a signe, and for a witnesse vnto the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts in the land of Egypt: for they shall crie vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, because of the oppressours, and he shal send them a Sauiour and a great One, and he shall deliuer them.
\v 21 And the \nd LORD\nd* shalbe knowen to Egypt, and the Egyptians shal know the \nd LORD\nd* in that day, and shal do sacrifice and oblation, yea they shall vow a vowe vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, and performe \add it\add*.

\v 23 ¶ In that day shall there be a hie way out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serue with the Assyrians.
\v 24 In that day shall Israel bee the third with Egypt, and with Assyria, \add euen\add* a blessing in the midst of the land:

\v 5 ¶ \x + \xo 66:5 \xt Cha.5.19.\x*Heare the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, ye that tremble at his word: Your brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my Names sake, sayd, Let the \nd LORD\nd* be glorified: but he shal appeare to your ioy, and they shalbe ashamed.

\v 7 Before she trauailed, she brought foorth: before her paine came, shee was deliuered of a man childe.
\v 8 Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seene such things? shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day, \add or\add* shall a nation be borne at once? for as soone as Zion traueiled, shee brought foorth her children.

\v 13 As one whom his mother comforteth, so wil I comfort you: and ye shall be comforted in Ierusalem.
\v 14 And when yee see \add this\add*, your heart shall reioyce, and your bones shall flourish like an herbe: and the hand of the \nd LORD\nd* shall be knowen towards \add his\add* seruants, and his indignation towards his enemies.
\v 15 For behold, the \nd LORD\nd* wil come with fire, and with his charets like a whirlewinde, to render his anger with furie, and his rebuke with flames of fire.
