\iex 1 Abishag cherisheth Dauid in his extreame age. 5 Adonijah, Dauids dearling, vsurpeth the kingdome. 11 By the counsel of Nathan, 15 Bath-sheba moueth the king, 22 and Nathan secondeth her. 28 Dauid reneweth his oath to Bath-sheba. 32 Salomon by Dauids appointment, beeing annointed King by Zadok and Nathan, the people triumph. 41 Ionathan, bringing these newes, Adoniiahs guests flie. 50 Adonijah flying to the hornes of the Altar, vpon his good behauiour is dismissed by Solomon.
\v 1 ¶ Now King Dauid was olde, \add and\add* \f + \fr 1:1 \ft Hebr. entred into dayes.\f*striken in yeeres, and they couered him with clothes, but hee gate no heate.
\v 2 Wherefore his seruants said vnto him, \f + \fr 1:2 \ft Heb. let them seeke.\f*Let there be sought for my lord the king \f + \fr 1:2 \ft Hebr. a damsell, a virgine.\f*a yong virgin, and let her stand before the King, and let her \f + \fr 1:2 \ft Heb. be a cherisher vnto him.\f*cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosome, that my lord the King may get heate.
\v 3 So they sought for a faire damosel throughout all the coasts of Israel, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the King.
\v 4 And the damosell \add was\add* very faire, and cherished the king, and ministred to him: but the king knew her not.
\v 5 ¶ Then Adoniiah the sonne of Haggith exalted himselfe, saying, I wil \f + \fr 1:5 \ft Heb. reigne\f*be king: And he prepared him charets and horesemen, and fiftie men to runne before him.
\v 6 And his father had not displeased him \f + \fr 1:6 \ft Heb. from his dayes.\f*at any time, in saying, Why hast thou done so? And hee also \add was a\add* very goodly \add man\add*, and \add his mother\add* bare him after Absalom.
\v 7 And hee \f + \fr 1:7 \ft Heb. his words were with Ioab.\f*conferred with Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the Priest: and they following Adoniiah, \f + \fr 1:7 \ft Heb. helped after Adonijah.\f*helped \add him\add*.
\v 8 But Zadok the Priest, and Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, and Nathan the Prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mightie men which \add belonged\add* to Dauid, were not with Adoniiah.
\v 9 And Adoniiah slew sheepe, and oxen, and fat cattell, by the stone of Zoheleth, which \add is\add* by \f + \fr 1:9 \ft Or, the well Rogel.\f*En-Rogel, and called all his brethren the kings sonnes, and all the men of Iudah the kings seruants.
\v 10 But Nathan the Prophet, and Benaiah, and the mightie men, and Solomon his brother he called not.
\v 11 ¶ Wherefore Nathan spake vnto Bath-sheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adoniiah the son of \x + \xo 1:11 \xt 2.Sam 3.4.\x*Haggith doth reigne, and Dauid our lord knoweth \add it\add* not?
\v 12 Now therefore come, let mee, I pray thee, giue thee counsell, that thou mayest saue thine owne life, and the life of thy sonne Solomon.
\v 13 Goe, and get thee in vnto King Dauid, and say vnto him, Diddest not thou, my lord, O king, sweare vnto thine handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy sonne shall reigne after mee, and he shall sit vpon my throne? why then doth Adoniiah reigne?
\v 14 Beholde, while thou yet talkest there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and \f + \fr 1:14 \ft Heb. fill vp.\f*confirme thy words.
\v 15 ¶ And Bath-sheba went in vnto the King into the chamber: and the king was very olde, and Abishag the Shunammite ministred vnto the king.
\v 16 And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeysance vnto the king: and the king said, \f + \fr 1:16 \ft Heb. what to thee?\f*What wouldest thou?
\v 17 And she said vnto him, My lord, thou swarest by the \nd LORD\nd* thy God vnto thine handmaid, \add saying\add*, Assuredly Solomon thy sonne shall reigne after me, and he shall sit vpon my throne:
\v 18 And now behold, Adoniiah reigneth; and now my lord the king, thou knowest \add it\add* not.
\v 19 And he hath slaine oxen, and fat cattell, and sheepe in abundance, and hath called all the sonnes of the king, and Abiathar the Priest, and Ioab the captaine of the hoste: but Solomon thy seruant hath he not called.
\v 20 And thou, my lord O king, the eyes of all Israel \add are\add* vpon thee, that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
\v 21 Otherwise it shall come to passe, when my lord the king shal sleepe with his fathers, that I and my sonne Solomon shall be counted \f + \fr 1:21 \ft Hebr. sinners.\f*offenders.
\v 22 ¶ And loe, while shee yet talked with the king, Nathan the Prophet also came in.
\v 23 And they tolde the king, saying, Beholde Nathan the Prophet. And when hee was come in before the king, he bowed himselfe before the king with his face to the ground.
\v 24 And Nathan said, My lord O king, hast thou said, Adoniiah shall reigne after mee, and hee shall sit vpon my throne?
\v 25 For hee is gone downe this day, and hath slaine oxen, and fat cattel, and sheepe in abundance, and hath called all the kings sonnes, and the captaines of the host, and Abiathar the Priest: and behold, they eate and drinke before him, and say, \f + \fr 1:25 \ft Hebr, Let king Adoniiah liue.\f*God saue king Adoniiah.
\v 26 But me, \add euen\add* me thy seruant, and Zadok the Priest, and Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, and thy seruant Solomon hath he not called.
\v 27 Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewed \add it\add* vnto thy seruant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the king, after him?
\v 28 ¶ Then king Dauid answered, and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came \f + \fr 1:28 \ft Hebr. before the king.\f*into the kings presence, and stood before the king.
\v 29 And the king sware, and said, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liueth, that hath redeemed my soule out of all distresse,
\v 30 Euen as I sware vnto thee by the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy sonne shall reigne after me, and he shal sit vpon my throne in my stead; euen so wil I certainly doe this day.
\v 31 Then Bathsheba bowed with \add her\add* face to the earth, and did reuerence to the king, and said, Let my lord king Dauid liue for euer.
\v 32 ¶ And king Dauid said, Call me Zadok the Priest, and Nathan the Prophet, and Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada. And they came before the king.
\v 33 The king also saide vnto them, Take with you the seruants of your lord, and cause Solomon my sonne to ride vpon \f + \fr 1:33 \ft Heb. which belongeth to me.\f*mine owne mule, and bring him downe to Gihon.
\v 34 And let Zadok the Priest, and Nathan the Prophet, anoint him there King ouer Israel: and blow ye with the trumpet, and say, God saue King Solomon.
\v 35 Then ye shall come vp after him, that hee may come and sit vpon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead: and I haue appointed him to be ruler ouer Israel, and ouer Iudah.
\v 36 And Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada answered the King, and said, Amen: The \nd LORD\nd* God of my lord the king say so \add too\add*.
\v 37 As the \nd LORD\nd* hath bene with my lord the King, euen so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater then the throne of my lord King Dauid.
\v 38 So Zadok the Priest, and Nathan the Prophet, and Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites went downe, and caused Solomon to ride vpon King Dauids mule, and brought him to Gihon.
\v 39 And Zadok the Priest tooke an horne of oile out of the Tabernacle, and anointed Solomon: and they blew the trumpet, and all the people said, God saue King Solomon.
\v 40 And all the people came vp after him, and the people piped with \f + \fr 1:40 \ft Or, flutes.\f*pipes, and reioyced with great ioy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.
\v 41 ¶ And Adoniiah and all the ghests that \add were\add* with him, heard \add it\add* as they had made an end of eating: and when Ioab heard the sound of the trumpet, hee said, Wherefore \add is this\add* noise of the citie, being in an vproare?
\v 42 And while hee yet spake, behold, Ionathan the sonne of Abiathar the Priest came, and Adoniiah sayde vnto him, Come in, for thou \add art\add* a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.
\v 43 And Ionathan answered, and said to Adoniiah, Uerily our lorde king Dauid hath made Solomon king.
\v 44 And the king hath sent with him Zadok the Priest, and Nathan the Prophet, and Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they haue caused him to ride vpon the kings mule.
\v 45 And Zadok the Priest, and Nathan the Prophet haue anointed him king in Gihon: and they are come vp from thence reioycing, so that the citie rang againe: this \add is\add* the noyse that yee haue heard.
\v 46 And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdome.
\v 47 And moreouer, the kings seruants came to blesse our lorde king Dauid, saying, God make the name of Solomon better then thy name, and make his throne greater then thy throne. And the king bowed himselfe vpon the bed.
\v 48 And also thus sayde the King, Blessed \add be\add* the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, which hath giuen \add one\add* to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes euen seeing \add it\add*.
\v 49 And all the guests that \add were\add* with Adoniiah, were afraid, and rose vp, and went euery man his way.
\v 50 ¶ And Adoniiah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, and caught hold on the hornes of the Altar.
\v 51 And it was tolde Solomon, saying, Behold, Adoniiah feareth King Solomon: for loe, he hath caught hold on the hornes of the Altar, saying, Let King Solomon sweare vnto mee to day, that hee will not slay his seruant with the sword.
\v 52 And Solomon sayd, If hee will shewe himselfe a worthy man, there shall not an haire of him fall to the earth: but if wickednesse shall be found in him, he shall die.
\v 53 So king Solomon sent, and they brought him downe from the Altar, and hee came and bowed himselfe to king Solomou: and Solomon sayde vnto him, Goe to thine house.

\iex 1 Dauid hauing giuen a charge to Solomon, 3 of religiousnesse, 5 of Ioab, 7 of Barzillai, 8 of Shimei, 10 dieth. 12 Solomon succeedeth. 13 Adoniiah, mouing Bath-sheba to sue vnto Solomon for Abishag, is put to death. 26 Abiathar hauing his life giuen him, is depriued of the Priesthood. 28 Ioab fleeing to the hornes of the Altar, is there slaine. 35 Benaiah is put in Ioabs roume, and Zadok in Abiathars. 36 Shimei confined to Ierusalem, by occasion of going thence to Gath, is put to death.
\v 1 ¶ Now the dayes of Dauid drew nigh, that he should die, and he charged Solomon his sonne, saying;
\v 2 I goe the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew thy selfe a man.
\v 3 \x + \xo 2:3 \xt Deut. 29. 9. iosh.1.7.\x*\f + \fr 2:3 \ft Or, doe wisely.\f*And keepe the charge of the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, to walke in his wayes, to keepe his Statutes, and his Commandements, & his Iudgements, and his Testimonies, as it is written in the Law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoeuer thou turnest thy selfe:
\v 4 \x + \xo 2:4 \xt 2. Sam. 7.12.\x*\f + \fr 2:4 \ft Heb. be cut off from thee from the throne.\f*That the \nd LORD\nd* may continue his word which hee spake concerning me, saying, If thy children take heede to their way, to walke before mee in trueth, with all their heart, and with all their soule, there shall not faile thee (sayd hee) a man on the throne of Israel.
\v 5 \x + \xo 2:5 \xt 2.Sam.3. 27.\x*\x + \xo 2:5 \xt 2.Sam. 20.10.\x*\f + \fr 2:5 \ft Heb. put.\f*Moreouer thou knowest also what Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah did to mee, \add and\add* what he did to the two captaines of the hostes of Israel, vnto Abner the sonne of Ner, and vnto Amasa the sonne of Iether, whom hee slewe, and shed the blood of warre in peace, and put the blood of warre vpon his girdle that \add was\add* about his loynes, and in his shooes that \add were\add* on his feet.
\v 6 Doe therefore according to thy wisedome, and let not his hoare head goe downe to the graue in peace.
\v 7 \x + \xo 2:7 \xt 2.Sam. 19.31.\x*But shewe kindnesse vnto the sonnes of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eate at thy table: for so they came to me when I fled because of Absalom thy brother.
\v 8 \x + \xo 2:8 \xt 2.Sam. 16.5.\x*\f + \fr 2:8 \ft Heb. strong\f*\x + \xo 2:8 \xt 2.Sam. 19.23.\x*And behold, \add thou hast\add* with thee Shimei the sonne of Gera, a Beniamite of Bahurim, which cursed mee with a grieuous curse, in the day when I went to Mahanaim: but hee came downe to meete me at Iordane, and I sware to him by the \nd LORD\nd*, saying, I will not put thee to death with the sword.
\v 9 Nowe therefore holde him not guiltlesse: for thou \add art\add* a wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to doe vnto him, but his hoare head bring thou downe to the graue with blood.
\v 10 \x + \xo 2:10 \xt Act 2. 29.and 13. 36.\x*So Dauid slept with his fathers, and was buried in the citie of Dauid.
\v 11 \x + \xo 2:11 \xt 2.Sam.5.4 1. chron.29 26,27.\x*And the dayes that Dauid raigned ouer Israel, \add were\add* fourty yeeres: seuen yeeres raigned hee in Hebron, and thirty and three yeeres raigned hee in Ierusalem.
\v 12 ¶ \x + \xo 2:12 \xt 2. Chron. 29.23.\x*Then sate Solomon vpon the throne of Dauid his father, and his kingdome was established greatly.
\v 13 ¶ And Adoniiah the sonne of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, and she said, Commest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.
\v 14 He said moreouer, I haue somewhat to say vnto thee. And she saide, Say on.
\v 15 And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdome was mine, and \add that\add* all Israel set their faces on me, that I should raigne: howbeit the kingdome is turned about, and is become my brothers: for it was his from the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 16 \f + \fr 2:16 \ft Heb. turne not away my face.\f*And now I aske one petition of thee, deny me not. And she saide vnto him, Say on.
\v 17 And hee saide, Speake, I pray thee, vnto Solomon the king (for hee will not say thee nay) that he giue me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.
\v 18 And Bathsheba said, Wel, I will speake for thee vnto the king.
\v 19 ¶ Bathsheba therefore went vnto king Solomon, to speake vnto him for Adoniiah: and the king rose vp to meete her, and bowed himselfe vnto her, and sate downe on his throne, and caused a seate to bee set for the Kings mother, and she sate on his right hand.
\v 20 Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee, \add I pray thee\add* say me not nay: and the King said vnto her, Aske on, my mother, for I will not say thee nay.
\v 21 And she saide, Let Abishag the Shunammite be giuen to Adoniiah thy brother to wife.
\v 22 And king Solomon answered, and said vnto his mother, And why doest thou aske Abishag the Shunammite for Adoniiah? Aske for him the kingdome also (for he \add is\add* mine elder brother) euen for him, and for Abiathar the Priest, & for Ioab the sonne of Zeruiah.
\v 23 Then king Solomon sware by the \nd LORD\nd*, saying, God doe so to me, and more also, if Adoniiah haue not spoken this word against his owne life.
\v 24 \x + \xo 2:24 \xt 2.Sam.7. 12,13.\x*Now therefore \add as\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liueth, which hath established mee, and set mee on the throne of Dauid my father, and who hath made me an house as he promised, Adoniiah shall be put to death this day.
\v 25 And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, and he fell vpon him that he died.
\v 26 ¶ \f + \fr 2:26 \ft Heb. a man of death.\f*And vnto Abiathar the Priest saide the King, Get thee to Anathoth, vnto thine own fields, for thou \add art\add* worthy of death: but I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the arke of the \nd LORD\nd* God before Dauid my father, and because thou hast bene afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.
\v 27 \x + \xo 2:27 \xt 1.Sam.2. 31,35.\x*So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from beeing Priest vnto the \nd LORD\nd*: that hee might fulfill the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, which hee spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.
\v 28 ¶ Then tidings came to Ioab (for Ioab had turned after Adoniiah, though hee turned not after Absalom) and Ioab fled vnto the Tabernacle of the \nd LORD\nd*, and caught hold on the hornes of the Altar.
\v 29 And it was told king Solomon that Ioab was fled vnto the Tabernacle of the \nd LORD\nd*, and behold, hee is by the Altar: Then Solomon sent Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, saying, Goe fall vpon him.
\v 30 And Benaiah came to the Tabernacle of the \nd LORD\nd*, and said vnto him, Thus saith the king, Come foorth. And he said, Nay, but I will die heere. And Benaiah brought the king word againe, saying, Thus said Ioab, and thus he answered me.
\v 31 And the king saide vnto him, Doe as he hath said, and fall vpon him, and bury him, that thou mayest take away the innocent blood which Ioab shed, from mee, and from the house of my father.
\v 32 \x + \xo 2:32 \xt 2.Sam. 3.27.\x*\x + \xo 2:32 \xt 2.Sam.20. 10.\x*And the \nd LORD\nd* shall returne his blood vpon his owne head, who fell vpon two men, more righteous and better then hee, and slew them with the sword, my father Dauid not knowing \add thereof, to wit\add*, Abner the sonne of Ner, captaine of the hoste of Israel, and Amasa the sonne of Iether, captaine of the hoste of Iudah.
\v 33 Their blood shall therefore returne vpon the head of Ioab, and vpon the head of his seed for euer: but vpon Dauid, and vpon his seede, and vpon his house, and vpon his throne, shall there bee peace for euer from the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 34 So Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada went vp, and fell vpon him, and slewe him, and hee was buried in his owne house in the wildernesse.
\v 35 ¶ And the king put Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada in his roome ouer the hoste, and Zadok the Priest did the king put in the roume of Abiathar.
\v 36 ¶ And the king sent, and called for Shimei, and said vnto him, Build thee an house in Ierusalem, and dwell there, and goe not forth thence any whither.
\v 37 For it shall be, \add that\add* on the day thou goest out, & passest ouer the brooke Kidron, thou shalt know for certaine, that thou shalt surely die: thy blood shal be vpon thine owne head.
\v 38 And Shimei said vnto the King, The saying \add is\add* good: as my lord the king hath said, so will thy seruant doe. And Shimei dwelt in Ierusalem many dayes.
\v 39 And it came to passe at the end of three yeeres, that two of the seruants of Shimei ranne away vnto Achish sonne of Maachah king of Gath: and they told Shimei, saying, Beholde, thy seruants \add be\add* in Gath.
\v 40 And Shimei arose, and sadled his asse, and went to Gath to Achish, to seeke his seruants: and Shimei went and brought his seruants from Gath.
\v 41 And it was told Solomon, that Shimei had gone from Ierusalem to Gath, and was come againe.
\v 42 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said vnto him, Did I not make thee to sweare by the \nd LORD\nd*, and protested vnto thee, saying, Know for a certaine, that on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any whither, that thou shalt surely die? And thou saidest vnto me, The word \add that\add* I haue heard, \add is\add* good.
\v 43 Why then hast thou not kept the Oath of the \nd LORD\nd*, and the commandement that I haue charged thee with?
\v 44 The king said moreuer to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickednesse which thine heart is priuie to, that thou diddest to Dauid my father: therefore the \nd LORD\nd* shall returne thy wickednesse vpon thine owne head.
\v 45 And king Solomon \add shall be\add* blessed, and the throne of Dauid shall bee established before the \nd LORD\nd* for euer.
\v 46 \x + \xo 2:46 \xt 2.Chron. 1.1.\x*So the king commaunded Benaiah the sonne of Iehoiada, which went out, and fell vpon him, that he died, and the kingdome was established in the hand of Solomon.

\iex 1 Solomon marieth Pharaohs daughter. 2 Hie places being in vse, Solomon sacrificeth at Gibeon. 5 Solomon at Gibeon, in the choice which God gaue him, preferring wisedome, obtaineth wisedome, riches, and honour. 16 Solomons iudgement betweene the two harlots, maketh him renowmed.
\v 1 ¶ \x + \xo 3:1 \xt Chap.7.8\x*And Solomon made affinitie with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and tooke Pharaohs daughter, and brought her into the citie of Dauid, vntill he had made an end of building his owne house, and the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and the wall of Ierusalem round about.
\v 2 Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built vnto the Name of the \nd LORD\nd* vntill those dayes.
\v 3 And Solomon loued the \nd LORD\nd*, walking in the statutes of Dauid his father: onely he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.
\v 4 And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that \add was\add* the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer vp on that Altar.
\v 5 ¶ In Gibeon the \nd LORD\nd* appeared to Solomon in a dreame by night: and God sayd, Aske what I shall giue thee.
\v 6 \f + \fr 3:6 \ft Or, bountie.\f*And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed vnto thy seruant Dauid my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in trueth, and in righteousnesse, and in vprightnesse of heart with thee, and thou hast kept for him this great kindnesse, that thou hast giuen him a sonne to sit on his throne, as \add it is\add* this day.
\v 7 And now, O \nd LORD\nd* my God, thou hast made thy seruant King in stead of Dauid my father: and I \add am but\add* a litle childe: I know not \add how\add* to goe out or come in.
\v 8 And thy seruant \add is\add* in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbred, nor counted for multitude.
\v 9 \x + \xo 3:9 \xt 2.Chron. 1.10.\x*\f + \fr 3:9 \ft Hebr. hearing.\f*Giue therefore thy seruant an understanding heart, to iudge thy people, that I may discerne betweene good and bad: for who is able to iudge this thy so great a people?
\v 10 And the speach pleased the \nd LORD\nd*, that Solomon had asked this thing.
\v 11 \f + \fr 3:11 \ft Hebr. many dayes.\f*\f + \fr 3:11 \ft Hebr. to beare.\f*And God said vnto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thy selfe long life, neither hast asked riches for thy selfe, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies, but hast asked for thy selfe vnderstanding to discerne iudgement;
\v 12 Behold, I haue done according to thy word: loe, I haue giuen thee a wise and an vnderstanding heart, so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like vnto thee.
\v 13 \x + \xo 3:13 \xt Matth.6. 33. wisd.7. 11.\x*\f + \fr 3:13 \ft Or, hath not bene.\f*And I haue also giuen thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the Kings like vnto thee, all thy dayes.
\v 14 \x + \xo 3:14 \xt Chap.15. 5.\x*And if thou wilt walke in my wayes, to keepe my Statutes and my Commandements, as thy father Dauid did walke, then I will lengthen thy dayes.
\v 15 And Solomon awoke, and behold, \add it was\add* a dreame: and he came to Ierusalem, and stood before the Arke of the Couenant of the \nd LORD\nd*, and offered vp burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his seruants.
\v 16 ¶ Then came there two women \add that were\add* harlots, vnto the king, and stood before him.
\v 17 And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house, and I was deliuered of a childe, with her in the house.
\v 18 And it came to passe the third day after that I was deliuered, that this woman was deliuered also: and wee \add were\add* together; \add there was\add* no stranger with vs in the house, saue we two in the house.
\v 19 And this womans childe died in the night: because she ouerlaid it.
\v 20 And shee arose at midnight, and tooke my sonne from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and layd it in her bosome, and layd her dead childe in my bosome.
\v 21 And when I rose in the morning to giue my childe sucke, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, beholde, it was not my sonne, which I did beare.
\v 22 And the other woman said, Nay, but the liuing \add is\add* my sonne, and the dead \add is\add* thy sonne: And this said, No, but the dead \add is\add* thy sonne, and the liuing \add is\add* my sonne. Thus they spake before the king.
\v 23 Then said the King, The one saith, This \add is\add* my sonne, that liueth, and thy sonne \add is\add* the dead: and the other saith Nay: but thy sonne \add is\add* the dead, and my sonne \add is\add* the liuing.
\v 24 And the King said, Bring mee a sword. And they brought a sword before the king:
\v 25 And the king said, Diuide the liuing childe in two, and giue halfe to the one, and halfe to the other.

\v 6 ¶ And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men that stood before Solomon his father, while he yet liued, and said, How doe you aduise, that I may answere this people?
\v 7 And they spake vnto him, saying, If thou wilt be a seruant vnto this people this day, and wilt serue them, and answere them, and speake good words to them, then they will be thy seruants for euer.

\v 10 And the young men that were growen vp with him, spake vnto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speake vnto this people that spake vnto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heauy, but make thou \add it\add* lighter vnto vs; thus shalt thou say vnto them, My litle \add finger\add* shall bee thicker then my fathers loynes.
\v 11 And now whereas my father did lade you with a heauy yoke, I wil adde to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whippes, but I will chastise you with scorpions.

\v 16 ¶ And there was war betweene Asa and Baasha King of Israel all their dayes.
\v 17 And Baasha king of Israel went vp against Iudah, and built Ramah, that he might not suffer any to goe out or come in to Asa king of Iudah.
\v 18 Then Asa tooke all the siluer and the golde \add that were\add* left in the treasures of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and the treasures of the kings house, and deliuered them into the hand of his seruants: and king Asa sent them to \x + \xo 15:18 \xt 2.

\v 21 And it came to passe when Baasha heard \add thereof\add*, that hee left off building of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.
\v 22 Then king Asa made a Proclamation throughout all Iudah, (none \add was\add* \f + \fr 15:22 \ft Hebr. free.\f*exempted:) and they tooke away the stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof wherewith Baasha had builded, and king Asa built with them Geba of Beniamin, and Mizpah.

\v 24 And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers, in the citie of Dauid his father: and \x + \xo 15:24 \xt Matth 1. 8. called Iosaphat.\x*Iehoshaphat his sonne reigned in his stead.

\v 26 And he did euill in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, and walked in the way of his father, and in his sinne wherewith hee made Israel to sinne.
\v 27 ¶ And Baasha the sonne of Ahiiah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him, and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belongeth to the Philistines, (for Nadab and all Israel layd siege to Gibbethon,)
\v 28 Euen in the third yeere of Asa king of Iudah, did Baasha slay him, and reigned in his stead.

\v 32 And there was warre betweene Asa and Baasha king of Israel al their dayes.

\v 3 Behold, I will take away the posteritie of Baasha, and the posteritie of his house: and will make thy house like \x + \xo 16:3 \xt Chap. 15. 29.\x*the house of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat.

\v 6 So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried in Tirzah, and Elah his sonne reigned in his stead.
\v 7 And also by the hand of the prophet Iehu the sonne of Hanani, came the word of the \nd LORD\nd* against Baasha, and against his house, euen for all the euill that hee did in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, in prouoking him to anger with the worke of his hands, in being like the house of Ieroboam, and because he killed him.

\v 14 Now the rest of the actes of Elah, and all that he did, \add are\add* they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel?

\v 16 And the people \add that were\add* encamped, heard say, Zimri hath conspired, and hath also slaine the king: Wherfore all Israel made Omri the captaine of the hoste, king ouer Israel that day, in the campe.
\v 17 And Omri went vp from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.
\v 18 And it came to passe when Zimri saw that the citie was taken, that hee went into the palace of the kings house, and burnt the kings house ouer him with fire, and died,

\v 4 \f + \fr 18:4 \ft Hebr. Izebel.\f*For it was \add so\add*, when Iezebel cut off the Prophets of the \nd LORD\nd*, that Obadiah tooke an hundred Prophets, and hid them by fiftie in a caue, and fed them with bread and water.)

\v 6 So they diuided the land betweene them to passe throughout it: Ahab went one way by himselfe, and Obadiah went another way by himselfe.
\v 7 ¶ And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Eliiah met him: and hee knew him, and fell on his face, and said; \add Art\add* thou that my lord Eliiah?
\v 8 And he answered him, I \add am\add*: goe, tell thy lord, Behold, Eliiah \add is here\add*.
\v 9 And he said, What haue I sinned, that thou wouldest deliuer thy seruant into the hand of Ahab, to slay mee?
\v 10 \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* thy God liueth, there is no nation or kingdome, whither my lord hath not sent to seeke thee: and when they said, \add He is\add* not \add there\add*, hee tooke an oath of the kingdome and nation, that they found thee not.
\v 11 And now thou sayest, Goe, tell thy lord, Behold, Eliiah \add is here\add*.
\v 12 And it shall come to passe, as soone as I am gone from thee, that the spirit of the \nd LORD\nd* shall cary thee whither I know not; and \add so\add* when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot finde thee, he shall slay mee: but I thy seruant feare the \nd LORD\nd* from my youth.
\v 13 Was it not told my lord, what I did when Iezebel slew the Prophets of the \nd LORD\nd*? How I hid an hundred men of the \nd LORD\nd*s Prophets, by fiftie in a caue, and fedde them with bread and water?
\v 14 And now thou sayest, Goe, tell thy lord, Behold, Eliiah \add is here\add*: and hee shall slay me.
\v 15 And Eliiah said, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* of hostes liueth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew my selfe vnto him to day.
\v 16 So Obadiah went to meete Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meete Eliiah.
\v 17 ¶ And it came to passe when Ahab saw Eliiah, that Ahab saide vnto him, \add Art\add* thou hee that troubleth Israel?
\v 18 And hee answered, I haue not troubled Israel, but thou and thy fathers house, in that yee haue forsaken the Commandements of the \nd LORD\nd*, and thou hast followed Baalim.
\v 19 Now therefore send, \add and\add* gather to mee all Israel vnto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal foure hundred and fiftie, and the prophets of the groues foure hundred, which eate at Iezebels table.

\v 22 Then said Eliiah vnto the people, I, \add euen\add* I onely remaine a Prophet of the \nd LORD\nd*: but Baals prophets \add are\add* foure hundred and fiftie men.
\v 23 Let them therefore giue vs two bullocks, and let them chuse one bullocke for themselues, and cut it in pieces, and lay \add it\add* on wood, and put no fire vnder: and I will dresse the other bullocke, and lay \add it\add* on wood, and put no fire vnder.

\v 25 And Eliiah said vnto the prophets of Baal, Chuse you one bullocke for your selues, and dresse \add it\add* first, for yee \add are\add* many: and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire vnder.

\v 28 \f + \fr 18:28 \ft Hebr. powred out blood vpon them.\f*And they cried loud, and cut themselues after their maner, with kniues, and lancers, till the blood gushed out vpon them.

\v 30 And Eliiah said vnto all the people, Come neere vnto me. And all the people came neere vnto him. And he repaired the Altar of the \nd LORD\nd* \add that was\add* broken downe.
\v 31 \x + \xo 18:31 \xt Gen.32 28. 2.king 17.34.\x*And Eliiah tooke twelue stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sonnes of Iacob, vnto whome the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came, saying, Israel shall bee thy name.
\v 32 And with the stones hee built an altar in the Name of the \nd LORD\nd*, and hee made a trench about the altar, as great as would containe two measures of seed.
\v 33 And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullocke in pieces, and laide \add him\add* on the wood, and said, Fill foure barrels with water, and powre \add it\add* on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.

\v 36 And it came to passe at \add the time of\add* the offering of the \add euening\add* sacrifice, that Eliiah the prophet came neere and said, \nd LORD\nd* God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, Let it bee knowen this day that thou \add art\add* God in Israel, and \add that\add* I \add am\add* thy seruant, and \add that\add* I haue done all these things at thy word.
\v 37 Heare me, O \nd LORD\nd*, heare me, that this people may know that thou \add art\add* the \nd LORD\nd* God, and \add that\add* thou hast turned their heart backe againe.
\v 38 Then the fire of the \nd LORD\nd* fell, and consumed the burnt sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked vp the water that \add was\add* in the trench.

\v 45 And it came to passe in the meane while, that the heauen was blacke with cloudes and winde, and there was a great raine: and Ahab rode and went to Iezreel.

\iex 1 Benhadad not content with Ahabs hommage, besiegeth Samaria. 13 By the direction of a Prophet, the Syrians are slaine. 22 As the Prophet forewarned Ahab, the Syrians trusting in the valleys, come against him in Aphek. 28 By the word of the Prophet, and Gods iudgment, the Syrians are smitten againe. 31 The Syrians submitting themselues, Ahab sendeth Benhadad away with a couenant. 35 The Prophet vnder the parable of a prisoner, making Ahab to iudge himselfe, denounceth Gods iudgement against him.

\v 2 \f + \fr 21:2 \ft Hebr. be good in thine eyes.\f*And Ahab spake vnto Naboth, saying, Giue me thy vineyard, that I may haue it for a garden of herbes, because it \add is\add* neere vnto my house, and I will giue thee for it a better vineyard then it: \add or\add* if it seeme good to thee, I will giue thee the worth of it in money.
\v 3 And Naboth said to Ahab, The \nd LORD\nd* forbid it mee, that I should giue the inheritance of my fathers vnto thee.
\v 4 And Ahab came into his house, heauie, and displeased, because of the word which Naboth the Iezreelite had spoken to him: for he had saide, I will not giue thee the inheritance of my fathers: and he laid him downe vpon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eate no bread.
\v 5 ¶ But Iezebel his wife came to him, and said vnto him, Why is thy spirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?
\v 6 And he said vnto her, Because I spake vnto Naboth the Iezreelite, and said vnto him, Giue mee thy vineyard for money, or else if it please thee, I will giue thee \add another\add* vineyard for it: And he answered, I wil not giue thee my vineyard.
\v 7 And Iezebel his wife saide vnto him, Doest thou now gouerne the kingdome of Israel? Arise, \add and\add* eate bread, and let thine heart bee merrie: I will giue thee the vineyard of Naboth the Iezreelite.
\v 8 So shee wrote letters in Ahabs name, and sealed \add them\add* with his seale, and sent the letters vnto the Elders, and to the Nobles that \add were\add* in his citie dwelling with Naboth.
\v 9 \f + \fr 21:9 \ft Heb. in the top of the people.\f*And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaime a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:
\v 10 And set two men, sonnes of Belial before him, to beare witnes against him, saying, Thou diddest blaspheme God and the king: and \add then\add* carie him out, and stone him that he may die.
\v 11 And the men of his citie, \add euen\add* the Elders \add and\add* the Nobles who were the inhabitants in his citie, did as Iezebel had sent vnto them, and as it \add was\add* written in the letters which she had sent vnto them.
\v 12 They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.
\v 13 And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sate before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, \add euen\add* against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king. Then they caried him foorth out of the citie, and stoned him with stones, that hee died.
\v 14 Then they sent to Iezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.
\v 15 ¶ And it came to passe when Iezebel heard that Naboth was stoned and was dead, that Iezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the Uineyard of Naboth the Iezreelite, which hee refused to giue thee for money: for Naboth is not aliue, but dead.
\v 16 And it came to passe when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose vp to goe downe to the Uineyard of Naboth the Iezreelite, to take possession of it.
\v 17 ¶ And the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came to Eliiah the Tishbite, saying,
\v 18 Arise, goe downe to meet Ahab king of Israel, which \add is\add* in Samaria: behold, hee is in the Uineyard of Naboth, whither \add he is\add* gone downe to possesse it.
\v 19 And thou shalt speake vnto him, saying, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Hast thou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speake vnto him, saying, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*; In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth, shall dogges licke thy blood, euen thine.
\v 20 And Ahab said to Eliiah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemie? And he answered, I haue found \add thee\add*: because thou hast sold thy selfe to worke euill in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 21 \x + \xo 21:21 \xt Chap.14. 10. 2.king. 9.8.\x*\x + \xo 21:21 \xt 1.Sam. 25.22.\x*\x + \xo 21:21 \xt Chap.14. 10.\x*Behold, I will bring euill vpon thee, and will take away thy posteritie, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut vp, and left in Israel,
\v 22 \x + \xo 21:22 \xt Chap. 15. 29.\x*\x + \xo 21:22 \xt Chap.16. 3.\x*And will make thine house like the house of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the sonne of Ahiiah, for the prouocation wherewith thou hast prouoked mee to anger, and made Israel to sinne.
\v 23 \x + \xo 21:23 \xt 2.King.9. 36.\x*\f + \fr 21:23 \ft Or, ditch.\f*And of Iezebel also spake the \nd LORD\nd*, saying, The dogs shall eate Iezebel by the wall of Iezreel.
\v 24 Him that dieth of Ahab in the citie, the dogs shall eate: and him that dieth in the field, shall the foules of the aire eat.
\v 25 ¶ \f + \fr 21:25 \ft Or, incited.\f*But there was none like vnto Ahab, which did sell himselfe to worke wickednesse in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, whom Iezebel his wife stirred vp.
\v 26 And hee did very abominably in following Idoles, according to all \add things\add* as did the Amorites, whom the \nd LORD\nd* cast out before the children of Israel.
\v 27 And it came to passe when Ahab heard those wordes, that hee rent his clothes, and put sackecloth vpon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.
\v 28 And the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came to Eliiah the Tishbite, saying,
\v 29 Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himselfe before mee? because hee humbleth himselfe before mee, I will not bring the euill in his dayes: \add but\add* in his sonnes dayes will I bring the euill vpon his house.

\iex 1 Ahab seduced by false prophets, according to the word of Micaiah, is slaine at Ramoth Gilead. 37 The dogges licke vp his blood, and Ahaziah succeedeth him. 41 Iehoshaphats good reigne, 45 his acts. 50 Iehoram succeedeth him. 51 Ahaziahs euil reigne.
\v 1 ¶ \x + \xo 22:1 \xt 1.Chron. 18.1, &c.\x*And they continued three yeeres without warre betweene Syria and Israel.
\v 2 And it came to passe on the third yere, that Iehoshaphat the King of Iudah came downe to the king of Israel.
\v 3 \f + \fr 22:3 \ft Hebr. silent from taking it.\f*(And the king of Israel said vnto his seruants, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead \add is\add* ours, and wee \add be\add* still, \add and\add* take it not out of the hand of the king of Syria?)
\v 4 \x + \xo 22:4 \xt 2.King.3. 7.\x*And hee said vnto Iehoshaphat, Wilt thou goe with me to battel to Ramoth Gilead? And Iehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I \add am\add* as thou \add art\add*, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.
\v 5 And Iehoshaphat said vnto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the \nd LORD\nd* to day.
\v 6 Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together about foure hundred men, and said vnto them, Shall I goe against Ramoth Gilead to battell, or shall I forbeare? And they said, Goe vp, for the \nd LORD\nd* shall deliuer \add it\add* into the hand of the king.
\v 7 And Iehoshaphat said, \add Is there\add* not here a Prophet of the \nd LORD\nd* besides, that we might enquire of him?
\v 8 And the king of Israel said vnto Iehoshaphat, \add There is\add* yet one man, (Micaiah the sonne of Imlah) by whom we may enquire of the \nd LORD\nd*; but I hate him, for he doth not prophesie good concerning me, but euill. And Iehoshaphat said, Let not the King say so.
\v 9 \f + \fr 22:9 \ft Or, Eunuch.\f*Then the king of Israel called an Officer, and said, Hasten \add hither\add* Micaiah the sonne of Imlah.
\v 10 \f + \fr 22:10 \ft Heb. floore.\f*And the King of Israel and Iehoshaphat the King of Iudah sate each on his throne, hauing put on their robes, in a voyd place in the entrance of the gate of Samaria, and all the Prophets prophecied before them.
\v 11 And Zedekiah the sonne of Chenaanah made him hornes of yron: and he sayd, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, With these shalt thou push the Syrians, vntill thou haue consumed them.
\v 12 And all the Prophets prophecied so, saying; Goe vp to Ramoth Gilead, and prosper: for the \nd LORD\nd* shall deliuer \add it\add* into the kings hand.
\v 13 And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah, spake vnto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets \add declare\add* good vnto the King with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, bee like the word of one of them, and speake \add that which is\add* good.
\v 14 And Micaiah sayde, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liueth, what the \nd LORD\nd* saith vnto me, that will I speake.
\v 15 ¶ So he came to the king, and the king sayd vnto him, Micaiah, shall wee goe against Ramoth Gilead to battell, or shall we forbeare? And he answered him, Go, and prosper: for the \nd LORD\nd* shall deliuer \add it\add* into the hand of the king.
\v 16 And the king said vnto him, How many times shall I adiure thee, that thou tell me nothing but \add that which is\add* true, in the Name of the \nd LORD\nd*?
\v 17 And hee sayd, I saw all Israel scattered vpon the hilles, as sheepe that haue not a shepheard. And the \nd LORD\nd* said, These haue no master, let them returne euery man to his house in peace.
\v 18 And the King of Israel said vnto Iehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee, that he would prophecie no good concerning me, but euill?
\v 19 And he said, Heare thou therefore the word of the \nd LORD\nd*: I sawe the \nd LORD\nd* sitting on his Throne, and all the hoste of heauen standing by him, on his right hand and on his left.
\v 20 \f + \fr 22:20 \ft Or, deceiue.\f*And the \nd LORD\nd* said, Who shall perswade Ahab, that hee may goe vp and fall at Ramoth Gilead? And one sayd on this manner, and another said on that manner.
\v 21 And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the \nd LORD\nd*, and said, I will perswade him.
\v 22 And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto him, Wherewith? And hee sayd, I will goe foorth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shalt perswade \add him\add*, and preuaile also: Goe forth, and doe so.
\v 23 Now therfore behold, the \nd LORD\nd* hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and the \nd LORD\nd* hath spoken euill concerning thee.
\v 24 \x + \xo 22:24 \xt 2. Chron. 18.23.\x*But Zedekiah the sonne of Chenaanah went neere, and smote Micaiah on the cheeke, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the \nd LORD\nd* from me, to speake vnto thee?
\v 25 \f + \fr 22:25 \ft Or, from chamber to chamber. Heb. chamber in a chamber.\f*And Micaiah sayde, Beholde, thou shalt see in that day, when thou shalt goe into an inner chamber, to hide thy selfe.
\v 26 And the King of Israel sayde, Take Micaiah, and cary him backe vnto Amon the gouernour of the citie, and to Ioash the kings sonne:
\v 27 And say, Thus sayth the King, Put this fellow in the prison, and feede him with bread of affliction, and with water of afflictiō, vntil I come in peace.
\v 28 And Micaiah saide, If thou returne at all in peace, the \nd LORD\nd* hath not spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, euery one of you.
\v 29 So the King of Israel, and Iehoshaphat the king of Iudah, went vp to Ramoth Gilead.
\v 30 \f + \fr 22:30 \ft Or, when he was to disguise himselfe and enter into the battell.\f*And the king of Israel said vnto Iehoshaphat, I wil disguise my selfe, & enter into the battell, but put thou on thy robes. And the King of Israel disguised himselfe, & went into the battell.
\v 31 But the King of Syria commanded his thirtie and two Captaines that had rule ouer his charets, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, saue only with the king of Israel.
\v 32 And it came to passe, when the captaines of the charets saw Iehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it \add is\add* the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him: and Iehoshaphat cryed out.
\v 33 And it came to passe, when the captaines of the charets perceiued that it \add was\add* not the king of Israel, that they turned backe from pursuing him.
\v 34 \f + \fr 22:34 \ft Heb. in his simplicitie.\f*\f + \fr 22:34 \ft Heb. ioynts and the brestplate.\f*\f + \fr 22:34 \ft Heb. made sicke.\f*And a \add certaine\add* man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel betweene the ioynts of the harnesse: wherefore hee sayd vnto the driuer of his charet, Turne thine hand, and cary me out of the hoste, for I am wounded.
\v 35 \f + \fr 22:35 \ft Hebr. ascended.\f*\f + \fr 22:35 \ft Heb. bosome.\f*And the battell increased that day: and the king was stayed vp in his charet against the Syrians, and died at euen: and the blood ranne out of the wound, into the mids of the charet.
\v 36 And there went a proclamation throughout the hoste, about the going downe of the Sunne, saying, Euery man to his citie, and euery man to his owne countrey.
\v 37 ¶ \f + \fr 22:37 \ft Heb. came.\f*So the King died, and was brought to Samaria, and they buried the king in Samaria.
\v 38 \x + \xo 22:38 \xt Chap. 21. 19.\x*And \add one\add* washed the charet in the poole of Samaria, and the dogges licked vp his blood, and they washed his armour, according vnto the word of the \nd LORD\nd* which he spake.
\v 39 Now the rest of the actes of Ahab, and all that he did, and the Iuory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, \add are\add* they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?
\v 40 So Ahab slept with his fathers, and Ahaziah his sonne reigned in his stead.
\v 41 ¶ \x + \xo 22:41 \xt 2. Chron. 20.31.\x*And Iehoshaphat the sonne of Asa began to reigne ouer Iudah in the fourth yeere of Ahab King of Israel.
\v 42 Iehoshaphat \add was\add* thirtie and fiue yeeres olde when hee began to reigne, and he reigned twentie and fiue yeeres in Ierusalem: and his mothers name \add was\add* Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
\v 43 And he walked in all the wayes of Asa his father, hee turned not aside from it, doing \add that which was\add* right in the eyes of the \nd LORD\nd*: neuerthelesse, the high places were not taken away: \add for\add* the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places.
\v 44 And Iehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
\v 45 Now the rest of the actes of Iehoshaphat, and his might that hee shewed, and how he warred, \add are\add* they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the Kings of Iudah?
\v 46 And the remnant of the Sodomites which remained in the dayes of his father Asa, he tooke out of the land.
\v 47 \add There was\add* then no king in Edom: a deputie \add was\add* king.
\v 48 \f + \fr 22:48 \ft Or, had ten ships.\f*Iehoshaphat made shippes of Tharshish to goe to Ophir for golde: but they went not, for the shippes were broken at Ezion Geber.
\v 49 Then said Ahaziah the sonne of Ahab vnto Iehoshaphat, Let my seruants goe with thy seruants in the ships: But Iehoshaphat would not.
\v 50 ¶ And Iehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the citie of Dauid his father: and Iehoram his sonne reigned in his stead.
\v 51 ¶ Ahaziah the sonne of Ahab began to reigne ouer Israel in Samaria the seuenteenth yeere of Iehoshaphat king of Iudah, and reigned two yeres ouer Israel.
\v 52 And he did euill in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, who made Israel to sinne.
\v 53 For he serued Baal, and worshipped him, and prouoked to anger the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, according vnto all that his father had done.
