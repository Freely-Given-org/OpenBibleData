\mt2 Iesus the sonne of Sirach,
\mt3 Or Ecclesiasticus.
\is1 ¶ A Prologue made by an vncertaine Authour.
\ip This Iesus was the sonne of Sirach, and grand-childe to Iesus of the same name with him; This man therefore liued in the latter times, after the people had bene led away captiue, and called home againe, and almost after all the Prophets. Now his grandfather Iesus (as he himselfe witnesseth) was a man of great diligence and wisedome among the Hebrewes, who did not onely gather the graue and short Sentences of wise men, that had bene before him, but himselfe also vttered some of his owne, full of much vnderstanding and wisedome. When as therefore the first Iesus died, leauing this booke almost perfected, Sirach his sonne receiuing it after him, left it to his owne sonne Iesus, who hauing gotten it into his hands, compiled it all orderly into one Volume, and called it Wisdome, Intituling it, both by his owne name, his fathers name, and his grandfathers, alluring the hearer by the very name of Wisedome, to haue a greater loue to the studie of this Booke. It conteineth therefore wise Sayings, darke Sentences, and Parables, and certaine particular ancient godly stories of men that pleased God. Also his Prayer and Song. Moreouer, what benefits God had vouchsafed his people, and what plagues he had heaped vpon their enemies. This Iesus did imitate Solomon, and was no lesse famous for Wisedome, and learning, both being indeed a man of great learning, and so reputed also.
\is1 ¶ The Prologue of the Wisdome of Iesus the sonne of Sirach.
\ip Whereas many and great things haue bene deliuered vnto vs by the Law and the Prophets, and by others that haue followed their steps, for the which things Israel ought to be commended for learning and Wisedome, and whereof not onely the Readers must needs become skilful themselues, but also they that desire to learne, be able to profit them which are without, both by speaking and writing : My grandfather Iesus, when he had much giuen himselfe to the reading of the Law, and the Prophets, and other Bookes of our fathers, and had gotten therein good iudgement, was drawen on also himselfe, to write something pertayning to learning and Wisedome, to the intent that those which are desirous to learne, and are addicted to these things, might profit much more in liuing according to the Law. Wherefore, let me intreat you to reade it with fauour and attention, and to pardon Vs, wherein wee may secme to come short of some words which we haue laboured to interprete. For the same things vttered in Hebrew, and translated into an other tongue, haue not the same force in them : and not onely these things, but the Law it selfe, and the Prophets, and the rest of the Bookes, haue no small difference, when they are spoken in their owne language. For in the eight and thirtieth yeere comming into Egypt, when Euergetes was King, and continuing there some time, I found a Booke of no small learning, therefore I thought it most necessary for mee, to bestow some diligence and trauaile to interprete it: Vsing great watchfulnesse, and skill in that space, to bring the Booke to an end, and set it foorth for them also, which in a strange countrey are willing to learne, being prepared before in maners to line after the Law.

\iex 1 All wisedome is from God. 10 He giueth it to them that loue him. 12 The feare of God is full of many blessings. 28 To feare God without hypocrisie.
\v 1 ¶ All \f + \fr 1:1 \ft 1.Kings 3.9.\f*wisedome commeth from the Lord, and is with him for euer.
\v 2 Who can number the sand of the sea, and the drops of raine, and the dayes of eternity?
\v 3 Who can finde out the height of heauen, and the breadth of the earth, and the deepe, and wisedome?
\v 4 Wisedome hath beene created before all things, and the vnderstanding of prudence from euerlasting.
\v 5 The word of God most high, is the fountaine of wisdome, & her wayes are euerlasting commandements.
\v 6 \f + \fr 1:6 \ft Rom.11. 34.\f*To whom hath the root of wisdome beene reuealed? or who hath knowen her wise counsels?
\v 7 [Unto whom hath the knowledge of wisedome beene made manifest? and who hath vnderstood her great experience?]
\v 8 There is one wise and greatly to bee feared; the Lord sitting vpon his Throne.
\v 9 He created her, and saw her, and numbred her, and powred her out vpon all his workes.
\v 10 Shee [is] with all flesh according to his gift, and hee hath giuen her to them that loue him.
\v 11 The feare of the Lord is honour, and glory, and gladnesse, and a crowne of reioycing.
\v 12 \f + \fr 1:12 \ft Prou.1.7. psal.110.10\f*The feare of the Lord maketh a merrie heart, and giueth ioy and gladnesse, and a long life.
\v 13 Who so feareth the Lord, it shall goe well with him at the last, & he \f + \fr 1:13 \ft Or, shalbe blessed.\f*shall finde fauour in the day of his death.
\v 14 To feare the Lord, is the beginning of wisedome: and it was created with the faithfull in the wombe.
\v 15 Shee hath built an euerlasting foundation with men, and she shal continue \f + \fr 1:15 \ft 2.Chron. 20.21.\f*with their seede.
\v 16 To feare the Lord, is fulnesse of wisedome, and filleth men with her fruits.
\v 17 Shee filleth all their house with things desireable, and the garners with her increase.
\v 18 The feare of the Lord is a crowne of wisedome, making peace and perfect health to flourish, both which are the gifts of God: and it enlargeth their reioycing that loue him.
\v 19 Wisedome raineth downe skill and knowledge of vnderstanding, and exalteth them to honour that holde her fast.
\v 20 The root of wisedome is to feare the Lord, and the branches thereof are long life.
\v 21 The feare of the Lord driueth away sinnes: and where it is present, it turneth away wrath.
\v 22 A furious man cannot \f + \fr 1:22 \ft Or, escape punishment.\f*be iustified, for the sway of his fury shalbe his destruction.
\v 23 A patient man will beare for a time, and afterward ioy shall spring vp vnto him.
\v 24 He wil hide his words for a time, and the lippes of many shall declare his wisedome.
\v 25 The parables of knowledge are in the treasures of wisedome: but godlines is an abomination to a sinner.
\v 26 If thou desire wisedome, keepe the commaundements, and the Lord shall giue her vnto thee.
\v 27 For the feare of the Lord is wisdome, and instruction: and faith and meekenesse are his delight.
\v 28 \f + \fr 1:28 \ft Or, be not disobedient to.\f*Distrust not the feare of the Lord when thou art poore: and come not vnto him with a double heart.
\v 29 Be not an hypocrite in the sight of men, and take good heede what thou speakest.
\v 30 Exalt not thy selfe, lest thou fall, and bring dishonor vpon thy soule, and so God discouer thy secrets, and cast thee downe in the midst of the congregation, because thou camest not in trueth, to the feare of the Lord: but thy heart is full of deceit.

\iex 1 Gods seruants must looke for trouble, 7 and be patient, and trust in him. 12 For woe to them that doe not so. 15 But they that feare the Lord, will doe so.
\v 1 ¶ My sonne, if \f + \fr 2:1 \ft Mat.4.11. 2.tim.3.12. 1.pet.4.12.\f*thou come to serue the Lorde, prepare thy soule for temptation.
\v 2 \f + \fr 2:2 \ft Or, haste not.\f*Set thy heart aright, and constantly endure, and make not haste in time of trouble.
\v 3 Cleaue vnto him, and depart not away, that thou mayest be increased at thy last end.
\v 4 Whatsoeuer is brought vpon thee, take cheerefully, and bee patient when thou art changed to a lowe estate.
\v 5 \f + \fr 2:5 \ft Wisd.3.6 pro. 17.3.\f*For gold is tried in the fire, and acceptable men in the furnace of aduersitie.
\v 6 Beleeue in him, and he will helpe thee, order thy way aright, and trust in him.
\v 7 Ye that feare the Lord, waite for his mercie, and goe not aside, lest ye fall.
\v 8 Yee that feare the Lord, beleeue him, and your reward shall not faile.
\v 9 Ye that feare the Lord, hope for good, and for euerlasting ioy and mercy.
\v 10 Looke at the generations of old, and see, did euer any trust in the Lord, and was confounded? or did any abide in his feare, & was forsaken? or whom did hee euer despise, that called vpon him?
\v 11 \f + \fr 2:11 \ft Psal.37.25\f*For the Lord is full of compassion, and mercie, longsuffering, and very pitifull, and forgiueth sinnes, and saueth in time of affliction.
\v 12 Woe be to fearefull hearts, and faint hands, and the sinner that goeth two wayes.
\v 13 Woe vnto him that is faint hearted, for he beleeueth not, therefore shall he not be defended.
\v 14 Woe vnto you that haue lost patience: and what will ye doe when the Lord shall visite you?
\v 15 \f + \fr 2:15 \ft Ioh.14.20\f*They that feare the Lord, will not disobey his word, and they that loue him, will keepe his wayes.
\v 16 They that feare the Lord, will seeke that which is well pleasing vnto him, and they that loue him, shall bee filled with the Law.
\v 17 They that feare the Lord, will prepare their hearts, and humble their soules in his sight:
\v 18 Saying, We will fal into the hands of the Lord, and not into the hands of men: for as his maiestie is, so is his mercie.

\iex 3 Children must honour, and helpe both their parents. 21 We may not desire to knowe all things 26 The incorrigible must needes perish. 30 Almes are rewarded.
\v 1 ¶ Heare mee your father, O children, and doe thereafter, that ye may be safe.
\v 2 \f + \fr 3:2 \ft Exo.20.6. deut. 5. 10.\f*\f + \fr 3:2 \ft Or, iudgement.\f*For the Lord hath giuen the father honour ouer the children, and hath confirmed the authoritie of the mother ouer the sonnes.
\v 3 Who so honoureth his father, maketh an atonement for his sinnes.
\v 4 And he that honoureth his mother, is as one that layeth vp treasure.
\v 5 Who so honoureth his father, shal haue ioy of his owne children, and when he maketh his prayer, hee shall bee heard.
\v 6 He that honoureth his father, shal haue a long life, and he that is obedient vnto the Lord, shall bee a comfort to his mother.
\v 7 He that feareth the Lord, will honour his father, and will doe seruice vnto his parents, as to his masters.
\v 8 \f + \fr 3:8 \ft Exod.20. 12. deut. 5. 10.\f*Honour thy father and mother, both in word and deed, that a blessing may come vpon thee from them.
\v 9 \f + \fr 3:9 \ft Gene.27. 27. deu.33. 1.\f*For the blessing of the father establisheth the houses of children, but the curse of the mother rooteth out foundations.
\v 10 Glory not in the dishonour of thy father, for thy fathers dishonour is no glory vnto thee.
\v 11 For the glory of a man, is from the honour of his father, and a mother in dishonour, is a reproch to the children.
\v 12 My sonne, helpe thy father in his age, and grieue him not as long as hee liueth.
\v 13 \f + \fr 3:13 \ft Or, in all thine habilitie.\f*And if his vnderstanding faile, haue patience with him, and despise him not, when thou art in thy ful strength.
\v 14 For the relieuing of thy father shall not be forgotten: and in stead of sinnes it shall be added to build thee vp.
\v 15 In the day of thine affliction it shall be remembred, thy sinnes also shal melt away, as the yce in y\sup e\sup* faire warme weather.
\v 16 He that forsaketh his father, is as a blasphemer, and he that angreth his mother, is cursed of God.
\v 17 My sonne, goe on with thy businesse in meekenesse, so shalt thou be beloued of him that is approued.
\v 18 \f + \fr 3:18 \ft Phil.2.3.\f*The greater thou art, the more humble thy selfe, and thou shalt find fauour before the Lord.
\v 19 \f + \fr 3:19 \ft Psal.25. 9,14.\f*Many are in high place and of renowne: but mysteries are reueiled vnto the meeke.
\v 20 For the power of the Lord is great, and hee is honoured of the lowly.
\v 21 \f + \fr 3:21 \ft Prou.25. 27. rom.12. 3.\f*Seeke not out the things that are too hard for thee, neither search the things that are aboue thy strength.
\v 22 But what is commaunded thee, thinke thereupon with reuerence, for it is not needfull for thee, to see with thine eyes, the things that are in secret.
\v 23 Be not curious in vnnecessarie matters: for moe things are shewed vnto thee, then men vnderstand.
\v 24 For many are deceiued by their owne vaine opinion, and an euill suspition hath ouerthrowen their iudgement.
\v 25 Without eyes thou shalt want light: professe not the knowledge therfore that thou hast not.
\v 26 A stubborne heart shall fare euill at the last, and he that loueth danger shall perish therein.
\v 27 An obstinate heart shall be laden with sorrowes, and the wicked man shall heape sinne vpon sinne.
\v 28 \f + \fr 3:28 \ft Or, the proud man is not healed by his punishment.\f*In the punishment of the proud there is no remedie: for the plant of wickednesse hath taken roote in him.
\v 29 The heart of the prudent will vnderstand a parable, and an attentiue eare is the desire of a wise man.
\v 30 \f + \fr 3:30 \ft Psal.40.2. dan.4.24. matth.5. 7.\f*Water will quench a flaming fire, and almes maketh an attonement for sinnes.
\v 31 And hee that requiteth good turnes, is mindfull of that which may come heereafter: and when he falleth he shall find a stay.

\iex 1 We may not despise the poore or fatherlesse, 11 but seeke for Wisedome, 20 and not be ashamed of some things, nor gainsay the trueth, 30 nor be as lyons in our houses.
\v 1 ¶ My sonne, defraude not the poore of his liuing, and make not the needy eies to waite long.
\v 2 Make not an hungry soule sorrowfull, neither prouoke a man in his distresse.
\v 3 Adde not more trouble to an heart that is vexed, and deferre not to giue to him that is in neede.
\v 4 Reiect not the supplication of the afflicted, neither turne away thy face from a poore man.
\v 5 \f + \fr 4:5 \ft Or, him that asketh.\f*Turne not away thine eye from the needy, and giue him none occasion to curse thee:
\v 6 For if he curse thee in the bitternesse of his soule, his prayer shall be heard of him that made him.
\v 7 Get thy selfe the loue of the congregation, and bow thy head to a great man.
\v 8 Let it not grieue thee to bowe downe thine eare to the poore, and giue him a friendly answere with meekenesse.
\v 9 Deliuer him that suffreth wrong, from the hand of the oppressour, and be not faint hearted when thou sittest in iudgement.
\v 10 Be as a father vnto the fatherlesse, and in stead of a husband vnto their mother, so shalt thou be as the sonne of the most high, and he shall loue thee more then thy mother doeth.
\v 11 Wisedome exalteth her children, and layeth hold of them that seeke her.
\v 12 He that loueth her, loueth life, and they that seeke to her earely, shall be filled with ioy.
\v 13 He that holdeth her fast shall inherit glory, and wheresoeuer she entreth, the Lord will blesse.
\v 14 \f + \fr 4:14 \ft Or, in the sanctuary.\f*They that serue her shall minister to the Holy one, and them that loue her, the Lord doth loue.
\v 15 Who so giueth eare vnto her, shall iudge the nations, and he that attendeth vnto her, shall dwell securely.
\v 16 If a man commit himselfe vnto her, he shall inherite her, and his generation shall hold her in possession.
\v 17 For at the first she will walke with him by crooked wayes, and bring feare and dread vpon him, and torment him with her discipline, vntill she may trust his soule, and try him by her Lawes.
\v 18 Then wil she returne the straight way vnto him, and comfort him, and shew him her secrets.
\v 19 But if he goe wrong, she will forsake him, and giue him ouer to his owne ruine.
\v 20 Obserue the opportunitie, and beware of euill, and be not ashamed when it concerneth thy soule.
\v 21 For there is a shame that bringeth sinne, and there is a shame which is glorie and grace.

\v 23 \f + \fr 4:23 \ft Greeke, in time of sauing.\f*And refraine not to speake, when there is occasion to doe good, and hide not thy wisedome in her beautie.
\v 24 For by speach wisedome shall be knowen, and learning by the word of the tongue.
\v 25 In no wise speake against the trueth, but be abashed of the errour of thine ignorance.
\v 26 \f + \fr 4:26 \ft Or, and striue not against the streame.\f*Bee not ashamed to confesse thy sinnes, and force not the course of the riuer.
\v 27 Make not thy selfe an vnderling to a foolish man, neither accept the person of the mighty.
\v 28 Striue for the trueth vnto death, and the Lord shall fight for thee.

\v 2 Folow not thine owne minde, and thy strength, to walke in the wayes of thy heart:
\v 3 And say not, Who shall controll mee for my workes? for the Lord will surely reuenge thy pride.
\v 4 Say not, I haue sinned, and what harme hath happened vnto mee? for the Lord is long suffering, he wil in no wise let thee goe.

\v 13 Honour and shame is in talke; and the tongue of man is his fall.
\v 14 Be not called a whisperer, and lye not in wait with thy tongue: for a foule shame is vpon the thiefe, and an euill condemnation vpon the double tongue.

\v 2 Extoll not thy selfe in the counsell of thine owne heart, that thy soule bee not torne in pieces as a bull [straying alone.]
\v 3 Thou shalt eat vp thy leaues, and loose thy fruit, and leaue thy selfe as a dry tree.

\v 13 Separate thy selfe from thine enemies, and take heed of thy friends.
\v 14 A faithfull friend is a strong defence: and hee that hath found such an one, hath found a treasure.
\v 15 Nothing doeth counteruaile a faithful friend, and his excellencie is vnualuable.
\v 16 A faithfull friend is the medicine of life, and they that feare the Lord shal finde him.
\v 17 Who so feareth the Lord shall direct his friendship aright, for as he is, so shall his neighbour be also.
\v 18 My sonne, gather instruction from thy youth vp: so shalt thou finde wisedome till thine old age.

\v 6 Seeke not to be iudge, being not able to take away iniquitie, lest at any time thou feare the person of the mightie, and lay a stumbling blocke in the way of thy vprightnesse.
\v 7 Offend not against the multitude of a city, and then thou shalt not cast thy selfe downe among the people.
\v 8 Bind not one sinne vpon another, for in one thou shalt not be vnpunished.
\v 9 Say not, God wil looke vpon the multitude of my oblations, and when I offer to the most High God, he will accept it.
\v 10 Be not faint hearted when thou makest thy prayer, and neglect not to giue almes.

\v 3 Unlesse a man hold himselfe diligently in the feare of the Lord, his house shall soone be ouerthrowen.

\v 6 \f + \fr 27:6 \ft Matth.7. 17.\f*The fruite declareth if the tree haue beene dressed: so is the vtterance of a conceit in the heart of man.
\v 7 Praise no man before thou hearest him speake, for this is the triall of men.
\v 8 If thou followest righteousnesse, thou shalt obtaine her, and put her on, as a glorious long robe.
\v 9 The birds will resort vnto their like, so will truth returne vnto them that practise in her.
\v 10 As the Lyon lieth in waite for the pray: so sinne for them that worke iniquity.
\v 11 The discourse of a godly man is alwaies with wisedome: but a foole changeth as the Moone.
\v 12 If thou be among the vndiscreet, obserue the time: but be continually among men of vnderstanding.
\v 13 The discourse of fooles is irksome, and their sport is in the wantonnesse of sinne.
\v 14 The talke of him that sweareth much, maketh the haire stand vpright: and their braules make one stop his eares.
\v 15 The strife of the proud is blood-shedding, and their reuilings are grieuous to the eare.
\v 16 Who so discouereth secrets, looseth his credit: and shall neuer find friend to his minde.
\v 17 Loue thy friend, and be faithfull vnto him: but if thou bewrayest his secrets, follow no more after him.
\v 18 For as a man hath destroyed his enemie: so hast thou lost the loue of thy neighbour.
\v 19 As one that letteth a bird goe out of his hand, so hast thou let thy neighbour goe; and shalt not get him againe.
\v 20 Follow after him no more, for he is too far off, he is as a roe escaped out of the snare.
\v 21 As for a wound it may be bound vp, and after reuiling there may be reconcilement: but he that bewrayeth secrets is without hope.
\v 22 \f + \fr 27:22 \ft Prou. 10. 10.\f*He that winketh with the eies worketh euil, and he that knoweth him will depart from him.
\v 23 \f + \fr 27:23 \ft Or, alter his speach.\f*When thou art present he will speake sweetly, and will admire thy words: but at the last he will writhe his mouth, and slander thy sayings.
\v 24 I haue hated many things, but nothing like him, for the Lord will hate him.
\v 25 Who so casteth a stone on high, casteth it on his owne head, and a deceitfull stroke shall make wounds.
\v 26 \f + \fr 27:26 \ft Psal.7.15. prou.26. 27. ecclesi. 8.10.\f*Who so diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that setteth a trap shall be taken therein.

\v 28 \f + \fr 27:28 \ft Deut.32. 35. rom.12. 19.\f*Mockery and reproach are from the proud: but vengeance as a Lyon shall lie in waite for them.
\v 29 They that reioyce at the fall of the righteous shalbe taken in the snare, and anguish shall consume them before they die.
\v 30 Malice and wrath, euen these are abhominations, and the sinfull man shall haue them both.

\iex 1 Against reuenge. 8 Quarrelling, 10 Anger, 15 And backbiting.
\v 1 ¶ He that reuengeth shall find vengeance from the Lord, and he will surely keepe his sinnes (in remembrance.)
\v 2 Forgiue thy neighbour the hurt that he hath done vnto thee, so shall thy sinnes also be forgiuen when thou prayest.
\v 3 One man beareth hatred against another, and doeth he seeke pardon from the Lord?
\v 4 Hee sheweth no mercy to a man, which is like himselfe: and doeth hee aske forgiuenesse of his owne sinnes?
\v 5 If he that is but flesh nourish hatred, who will intreat for pardon of his sinnes?
\v 6 Remember thy end, and let enimitie cease, [remember] corruption and death, and abide in the Commandements.
\v 7 Remember the Commaundements, & beare no malice to thy neighbour: [remember] the Couenant of the highest, and winke at ignorance.
\v 8 \f + \fr 28:8 \ft Chap.8.1.\f*Abstaine from strife, and thou shalt diminish thy sinnes: for a furious man will kindle strife.
\v 9 A sinfull man disquieteth friends, and maketh debate among them that be at peace.
\v 10 \f + \fr 28:10 \ft Prou.26. 21.\f*As the matter of the fire is, so it burneth: and as a mans strength is, so is his wrath, and according to his riches his anger riseth, and the stronger they are which contend, the more they will be inflamed.
\v 11 An hastie contention kindleth a fire, and an hasty fighting sheddeth blood.
\v 12 If thou blow the sparke, it shall burne: if thou spit vpon it, it shall bee quenched, and both these come out of thy mouth.
\v 13 \f + \fr 28:13 \ft Chap. 21. 28.\f*Curse the whisperer, and double tongued: for such haue destroyed many that were at peace.
\v 14 A backbiting tongue hath disquieted many, and driuen them from nation to nation, strong cities hath it pulled down, and ouerthrowen the houses of great men.
\v 15 \f + \fr 28:15 \ft Or, third.\f*A backbiting tongue hath cast out vertuous women, and depriued them of their labours.
\v 16 Who so hearkeneth vnto it, shall neuer finde rest, and neuer dwel quietly.
\v 17 The stroke of the whip maketh markes in the flesh, but the stroke of the tongue breaketh the bones.
\v 18 Many haue fallen by the edge of the sword: but not so many as haue fallen by the tongue.
\v 19 Well is hee that is defended from it, and hath not passed through the venime thereof: who hath not drawen the yoke thereof, nor hath bene bound in her bands.
\v 20 For the yoke thereof is a yoke of yron, and the bands thereof are bandes of brasse.
\v 21 The death therof is an euil death, the graue were better then it.
\v 22 It shall not haue rule ouer them that feare God, neither shall they be burnt with the flame thereof.
\v 23 Such as forsake the Lord shall fall into it, and it shall burne in them, and not be quenched, it shalbe sent vpon them as a Lion, and deuoure them as a Leopard.
\v 24 Looke that thou hedge thy possession about with thornes, and binde vp thy siluer and gold:
\v 25 And weigh thy words in a ballance, and make a doore and barre for thy mouth.
\v 26 Beware thou slide not by it, lest thou fall before him that lieth in wait.

\iex 2. Wee must shew mercy and lend: 4 but the borower must not defraud the lender. 9 Giue almes. 14 A good man will not vndoe his suretie. 18 To be suretie and vndertake for others is dangerous. 22 It is better to liue at home, then to soiourne.
\v 1 ¶ Hee that is mercifull, will lende vnto his neighbour, and hee that strengthneth his hande, keepeth the Commandements.

\v 3 Keepe thy word & deale faithfully with him, and thou shalt alwaies finde the thing that is necessary for thee.
\v 4 Many when a thing was lent them, reckoned it to be found, and put them to trouble that helped them.
\v 5 Till he hath receiued, he will kisse a mans hand: and for his neighbours money he will speake submissely: but when he should repay, he will prolong the time, and returne words of griefe, and complaine of the time.
\v 6 \f + \fr 29:6 \ft Or, if he be able.\f*If he preuaile, he shall hardly receiue the halfe, and he will count as if he had found it: if not; he hath depriued him of his money, and he hath gotten him an enemy without cause: he payeth him with cursings, and raylings: and for honour he will pay him disgrace.
\v 7 Many therefore haue refused to lend for other mens ill dealing, fearing to be defrauded.
\v 8 Yet haue thou patience with a man in poore estate, and delay not to shew him mercy.
\v 9 Helpe the poore for the commandements sake, and turne him not away because of his pouertie.

\v 14 \f + \fr 29:14 \ft Or, faile.\f*An honest man is suretie for his neighbour: but hee that is impudent, will forsake him.
\v 15 Forget not the friendship of thy suretie: for hee hath giuen his life for thee.
\v 16 A sinner will ouerthrow the good estate of his suretie:
\v 17 And he that is of an vnthankfull minde, will leaue him in [danger] that deliuered him.
\v 18 Suretiship hath vndone many of good estate, and shaked them as a waue of the Sea: mightie men hath it driuen from their houses, so that they wandred among strange nations.
\v 19 A wicked man transgressing the commandements of the Lord, shall fall into suretiship: and hee that vndertaketh and followeth other mens businesse for gaine, shall fall into suits.
\v 20 Helpe thy neighbour according to thy power, and beware that thou thy selfe fall not into the same.
\v 21 \f + \fr 29:21 \ft Chap.39. 26.\f*The chiefe thing for life is water and bread, and clothing, and an house to couer shame.
\v 22 Better is the life of a poore man in a meane cottage, then delicate fare in another mans house.
\v 23 Be it little or much, holde thee contented, that thou heare not the reproch of thy house.
\v 24 For it is a miserable life to goe from house to house: for where thou art a stranger, thou darest not open thy mouth.
\v 25 Thou shalt entertaine and feast, and haue no thankes: moreouer, thou shalt heare bitter words.
\v 26 Come thou stranger, and furnish a table, and feede me of that thou hast ready.
\v 27 Giue place thou stranger to an honourable man, my brother commeth to be lodged, and I haue neede of mine house.
\v 28 These things are grieuous to a man of vnderstanding: the vpbraiding of house-roome, and reproching of the lender.

\v 4 Though his father die, yet he is as though hee were not dead: for hee hath left one behinde him that is like himselfe.

\v 6 He left behinde him an auenger against his enemies, and one that shall requite kindnesse to his friends.
\v 7 He that maketh too much of his sonne, shall binde vp his wounds, and his bowels wil be troubled at euery cry.

\v 28 Wine measurably drunke, and in season, bringeth gladnesse of the heart and cheerefulnesse of the minde.

\v 11 Keepe a sure watch ouer a shamelesse daughter, lest shee make thee a laughing stocke to thine enemies, and a by-word in the citie, and a reproch among the people, and make thee ashamed before the multitude.

\v 2 And by him was built from the foundation the double height, the high fortresse of the wall about the Temple.
\v 3 \f + \fr 50:3 \ft 1.King.7. 23.\f*In his dayes the cisterne to receiue water being in compasse as the sea, was couered with plates of brasse.
\v 4 He tooke care of the Temple that it should not fall, and fortified the citie against besieging.
\v 5 \f + \fr 50:5 \ft Gr. the house of the vaile.\f*How was he honoured in the midst of the people, in his comming out of the Sanctuarie?
\v 6 He was as the morning starre in the midst of a cloud: and as the moone at the full.
\v 7 As the Sunne shining vpon the Temple of the most High, and as the rainebow giuing light in the bright cloudes.
\v 8 And as the flowre of roses in the spring of the yeere, as lillies by the riuers of waters, and as the branches of the frankincense tree in the time of summer.
\v 9 As fire and incense in the censer, and as a vessell of beaten gold set with all maner of precious stones,
\v 10 And as a faire oliue tree budding forth fruit, and as a Cypresse tree which groweth vp to the cloudes.
\v 11 When he put on the robe of honour, and was clothed with the perfection of glory, when he went vp to the holy altar, he made the garment of holinesse honourable.
\v 12 When he tooke the portions out of the priests hands, hee himselfe stood by the hearth of the altar, compassed with his brethren round about, as a yong cedar in Libanus, and as palme trees compassed they him round about.
\v 13 So were all the sonnes of Aaron in their glory, and the oblations of the Lord in their hands, before all the congregation of Israel.
\v 14 And finishing the seruice at the altar, that he might adorne the offring of the most high Almighty,
\v 15 He stretched out his hand to the cup, and powred of the blood of the grape, he powred out at the foote of the altar, a sweet smelling sauour vnto the most high King of all.
\v 16 \f + \fr 50:16 \ft Or, trumpets beaten forth with the hammer.\f*Then shouted the sonnes of Aaron, and sounded the siluer trumpets, and made a great noise to be heard, for a remembrance before the most High.
\v 17 Then all the people together hasted, and fell downe to the earth vpon their faces to worship their Lord God almighty the most High.
\v 18 The singers also sang praises with their voices, with great variety of sounds was there made sweete melodie.
\v 19 And the people besought the Lord the most High by prayer before him that is mercifull, till the solemnity of the Lord was ended, and they had finished his seruice.
\v 20 Then he went downe, and lifted vp his hands ouer the whole congregation of the children of Israel, to giue the blessing of the Lord with his lips, and to reioyce in his name.
\v 21 And they bowed themselues downe to worship the second time, that they might receiue a blessing from the most High.
\v 22 Now therefore blesse yee the God of all, which onely doth wonderous things euery where, which exalteth our daies from the wombe, and dealeth with vs according to his mercy.
\v 23 He grant vs ioyfulnesse of heart, and that peace may be in our daies in Israel for euer.
\v 24 That hee would confirme his mercy with vs, and deliuer vs at his time.
\v 25 There be two maner of nations which my heart abhorreth, and the third is no nation.
\v 26 They that sit vpon the mountaine of Samaria, and they that dwell amongst the Philistines, and that foolish people that dwell in Sichem.
\v 27 Iesus the sonne of Sirach of Hierusalem hath written in this booke, the instruction of vnderstanding and knowledge, who out of his heart powred forth wisedome.
\v 28 Blessed is he that shall be exercised in these things, and hee that layeth them vp in his heart, shall become wise.
\v 29 For if he doe them, hee shall be strong to all things, for the light of the Lord leadeth him, who giueth wisedome to the godly: blessed be the Lord for euer. Amen. Amen.
