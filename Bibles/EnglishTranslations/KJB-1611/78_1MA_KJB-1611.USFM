\iex 14 Antiochus gaue leaue to set vp the fashions of the Gentiles in Hierusalem, 22 And spoiled it, & the temple in it, 57 And set vp therin the abomination of desolation, 63 And slew those that did circumcise their children.
\v 1 ¶ And it happened, after that Alexander sonne of Philip, the Macedonian, who came out of the land of \f + \fr 1:1 \ft Or. Chethum.\f*Chettum, had smitten Darius king of the Persians and Medes, that hee reigned in his stead, the first ouer Greece,
\v 2 And made many wars, and wan many strong holds, and slew the kings of the earth,
\v 3 And went through to the ends of the earth, and tooke spoiles of many nations, insomuch, that the earth was quiet before him, whereupon \f + \fr 1:3 \ft Or, his heart was exalted and lifted vp.\f*he was exalted, and his heart was lifted vp.
\v 4 And he gathered a mighty strong hoste, and ruled ouer countries, and nations and \f + \fr 1:4 \ft Or, kingdomes which became &c.\f*kings, who became tributaries vnto him.
\v 5 And after these things he fell sicke, and perceiued \f + \fr 1:5 \ft Gre that he dieth.\f*that he should die.
\v 6 Wherefore he called his seruants, such as were honourable, and had bin brought vp with him from his youth, and parted kis kingdome among them, while he was yet aliue:
\v 7 So Alexander reigned twelue yeeres, and (then) died.
\v 8 And his seruants bare rule euery one in his place.
\v 9 And after his death they all put crownes [vpon themselues] so did their sonnes after them, many yeeres, and euils were multiplied in the earth.
\v 10 And there came out of them a wicked roote, Antiochus [surnamed] Epiphanes, sonne of Antiochus the king, who had beene an hostage at Rome, and he reigned in the hundreth and thirty and seuenth yeere of the kingdome of the Greekes.
\v 11 In those daies went there out of Israel wicked men, who perswaded many, saying, Let vs goe, and make a couenant with the heathen, that are round about vs: for since we departed from them, \f + \fr 1:11 \ft Gre. many euils haue found vs.\f*we haue had much sorrow.
\v 12 So this deuise pleased them well.
\v 13 Then certaine of the people were so forward heerein, that they went to the king, who gaue them licence to doe after the ordinances of the heathen.
\v 14 Whereupon \f + \fr 1:14 \ft Or, set vp an open schoole at Ierusalem.\f*they built a place of exercise at Ierusalem, according to the customes of the heathen,
\v 15 And made themselues, vncircumcised, and forsooke the holy couenant, and ioyned themselues to the heathen, and were sold to doe mischiefe.
\v 16 Now when the kingdome was established, before Antiochus, hee thought to reigne ouer Egypt, that he might haue y\sup e\sup* dominion of two realms:
\v 17 Wherefore he entred into Egypt with a great multitude, with chariots, and elephants, and horsemen, and a great nauie,
\v 18 And made warre against Ptolomee king of Egypt, but Ptolomee was afraide of him, and fled: and many were wounded to death.
\v 19 Thus they got the strong cities in the land of Egypt, and hee tooke the spoiles thereof.
\v 20 And after that Antiochus had smitten Egypt, he returned againe in the hundreth fortie and third yeere, and went vp against Israel and Ierusalem with a great multitude,
\v 21 And entred proudly into the sanctuarie, and tooke away the golden altar, and the candlesticke of light, and all the vessels thereof,
\v 22 And the table of the shewbread, and the powring vessels, and the vials, and the censers of gold, & the vaile, and the crownes, & the golden ornaments that were before the temple, \f + \fr 1:22 \ft Or, he pilled all things.\f*all which he pulled off.
\v 23 Hee tooke also the siluer and the gold, and the \f + \fr 1:23 \ft Gr. desireable.\f*pretious vessels: also he tooke the hidden treasures which hee found:
\v 24 And when hee had taken all away, he went into his owne land, hauing made a great massacre, and spoken very proudly.
\v 25 Therfore there was great mourning in Israel, in euery place where they were;
\v 26 So that the Princes and Elders mourned, the virgines and yong men were made feeble, and the beautie of women was changed.
\v 27 Euery bridegrome tooke vp lamentation, and she that sate in the marriage chamber, was in heauinesse.
\v 28 The land also was moued for the inhabitants thereof, and all the house of Iacob was couered with confusion.
\v 29 And after two yeeres fully expired, the king sent his chiefe collectour of tribute vnto the cities of Iuda, who came vnto Ierusalem with a great multitude,
\v 30 And spake peaceable wordes vnto them, but [all was] deceit: for when they had giuen him credence, he fell suddenly vpon the citie, and smote it very sore, & destroyed much people of Israel.
\v 31 And when hee had taken the spoiles of the citie, hee set it on fire, and pulled downe the houses, and walles thereof on euery side.
\v 32 But the women & children tooke they captiue, and possessed the cattell.
\v 33 Then builded they the citie of Dauid with a great and strong wall, [and] with mightie towers, and made it a strong hold for them,
\v 34 And they put therein a sinfull nation, wicked men, and fortified [themselues] therein.
\v 35 They stored it also with armour and victuals, and when they had gathered together the spoiles of Ierusalem, they layd them vp there, and so they became a sore snare:
\v 36 For it was a place to lie in wait against the Sanctuary, and an euill aduersary to Israel.
\v 37 Thus they shed innocent blood on euery side of the Sanctuary, and defiled it.
\v 38 In so much that the inhabitants of Ierusalem fledde because of them, whereupon [the citie] was made an habitation of strangers, & became strange to those that were borne in her, and her owne children left her:
\v 39 Her Sanctuary was laid waste like a wildernesse, her feasts were turned into mourning, her Sabbaths into reproch, her honour into contempt.
\v 40 As had bene her glory, so was her dishonour encreased, and her excellencie was turned into mourning.
\v 41 Moreouer king Antiochus wrote to his whole kingdome, that all should be one people,
\v 42 And euery one should leaue his lawes: so all the heathen agreed, according to the commandement of the king.
\v 43 Yea many also of the Israelites consented to his religion, and sacrificed vnto idols, and prophaned the Sabbath.
\v 44 For the king had sent letters by messengers vnto Ierusalem, and the cities of Iuda, that they should follow \f + \fr 1:44 \ft Or, the lawes and rites of the strangers of the land.\f*the strange lawes of the land,
\v 45 And forbid burnt offerings, and sacrifice, and drinke offerings in the temple; and that they should prophane the Sabbaths, and festiuall dayes:
\v 46 And pollute the Sanctuarie and holy people:
\v 47 Set vp altars, and groues, and chappels of idols, and sacrifice swines flesh, and vncleane beasts:
\v 48 That they should also leaue their children vncircumcised, and make their soules abominable with all maner of vncleannesse, and prophanation:
\v 49 To the end they might forget the Law, and change all the ordinances.
\v 50 And whosoeuer would not doe according to the commandement of the king [he said] he should die.
\v 51 In the selfe same maner wrote he to his whole kingdome, and appointed ouerseers ouer all the people, commanding the cities of Iuda to sacrifice, citie by citie.
\v 52 Then many of the people were gathered vnto them, to wit, euery one that forsooke the Lawe, and so they committed euils in the land:
\v 53 \f + \fr 1:53 \ft Or, and they made Israel hide themselues in holes, in euery place of succour.\f*And droue the Israelites into secret places, euen wheresoeuer they could flie for succour.
\v 54 Now the fifteenth day of the moneth Casleu, in the hundreth fourtie and fift yeere, they set vp the abomination of desolation vpon the Altar, and builded idole altars throughout the cities of Iuda, on euery side:
\v 55 And burnt incense at the doores of their houses, and in the streetes.
\v 56 And when they had rent in pieces the bookes of the Lawe which they found, they burnt them with fire.
\v 57 And wheresoeuer was found with any, the booke of the Testament, or if any consented to the Lawe, \f + \fr 1:57 \ft Gr. the kings commandement put him to death.\f*the kings commandement was, that they should put him to death.
\v 58 Thus did they by their authority, vnto the Israelites euery moneth, to as many as were found in the cities.
\v 59 Now the fiue and twentieth day of the moneth, they did sacrifice vpon the idole altar, which was vpon the Altar of God.
\v 60 At which time, according to the commandement, they put to death certaine women \f + \fr 1:60 \ft Or, that had circumcised their children.\f*that had caused their children to be circumcised.
\v 61 And they hanged the infants about their neckes, and rifled their houses, and slewe them that had circumcised them.
\v 62 Howbeit, many in Israel were fully resolued and confirmed in themselues, not to eate any vncleane thing.
\v 63 Wherfore they chose rather to die, that they might not be defiled with meats, and that they might not profane the holy Couenant: So then they died.
\v 64 And there was very great wrath vpon Israel.
\c 2
\iex 6 Mattathias lamenteth the case of Ierusalem. 24 He slayeth a Iewe that did sacrifice to Idoles in his presence, and the Kings messenger also. 34 He and his are assailed vpon the Sabbath, and make no resistance. 50 Hee dieth, and instructeth his sons: 66 and maketh their brother Iudas Maccabeus generall.
\v 1 ¶ In those daies \f + \fr 2:1 \ft Or Mattathias the son of Iohn, [illeg.] arose from Ierusalem, or out of Ierusalem\f*arose Mattathias the son of Iohn, the sonne of Simeon, a Priest of the sonnes of Ioarib, from Ierusalem, and dwelt in Modin.
\v 2 And he had fiue sonnes, Ioannan \f + \fr 2:2 \ft Or, who was called: and so afterward in the rest.\f*called \f + \fr 2:2 \ft Gaddis.\f*Caddis:
\v 3 Simon, called Thassi:
\v 4 Iudas, who was called Maccabeus:
\v 5 Eleazar, called \f + \fr 2:5 \ft Or, Auaron, or Abaron.\f*Auaran, and Ionathan, whose surname was Apphus.
\v 6 And when hee saw the blasphemies that were committed in Iuda and Ierusalem,
\v 7 He said, Woe is me, wherfore was I borne to see this misery of my people, and of the holy citie, and to dwell there, when it was deliuered into the hand of the enemie, and the Sanctuary into the hand of strangers?
\v 8 Her Temple is become as a man without glory.
\v 9 Her glorious vessels are caried away into captiuitie, her infants are slaine in the streets, her yong men with the sword of the enemie.
\v 10 What nation hath not had a part in her kingdome, and gotten of her spoiles?
\v 11 All her ornaments are taken away, of a free-woman shee is become a bondslaue.
\v 12 And behold, our \f + \fr 2:12 \ft Or, holy thing.\f*Sanctuarie, euen our beautie, aud our glory is laid waste, & the Gentiles haue profaned it.
\v 13 To what ende therefore shall we liue any longer?
\v 14 Then Mattathias and his sons rent their clothes, and put on sackcloth, and mourned very sore.
\v 15 In the meane while the kings officers, such as compelled the people to reuolt, came into the city Modin to make them sacrifice.
\v 16 And when many of Israel came vnto them, Mattathias also and his sonnes came together.
\v 17 Then answered the kings officers, and said to Mattathias on this wise; Thou art a ruler, and an honourable and great man in this citie, and strengthened with sons and brethren:
\v 18 Now therefore come thou first and fulfill the kings commandement, like as all the heathen haue done; yea and the men of Iuda also, and such as remaine at Ierusalem: so shalt thou and thine house be in the number of the kings friends, and thou and thy children shall be honoured with siluer, and golde, and many rewards.
\v 19 Then Mattathias answered, and spake with a loude voice, Though all the nations that are vnder the kings dominion obey him, and fall away euery one from the religion of their fathers, and giue consent to his commandements:
\v 20 Yet will I, and my sonnes, and my brethren walke in the couenant of our fathers.
\v 21 God forbid that we should forsake the Law, and the ordinances:
\v 22 We will not hearken to the kings words, to goe from our religion, either on the right hand, or the left.
\v 23 Now when he had left speaking these words, there came one of the Iewes in the sight of all, to sacrifice on the altar, which was at Modin, according to the kings commandement.
\v 24 Which thing when Mattathias saw, he was inflamed with zeale, and his reines trembled, neither could hee forbeare to shew his anger according to iudgement: wherefore he ranne, and slew him vpon the altar.
\v 25 Also the kings commissioner who compelled men to sacrifice, he killed at that time, & the altar he pulled downe.
\v 26 \x + \xo 2:26 \xt Num.25.9.\x*Thus dealt he zealously for the Law of God, like as Phineas did vnto Zambri the sonne of Salom.
\v 27 And Mattathias cried throughout the citie with a loud voyce, saying, Whosoeuer is zealous of the law, and maintaineth the couenant, let him follow me.
\v 28 So he and his sonnes fled into the mountaines, and left all that euer they had in the citie.
\v 29 \f + \fr 2:29 \ft Gr. sit, abide.\f*Then many that sought after iustice and iudgement, went downe into the wildernesse to dwell there.
\v 30 \f + \fr 2:30 \ft Gr. euils were multiplied vpon them.\f*Both they and their children, and their wiues, and their cattell, because afflictions increased sore vpon them.
\v 31 Now when it was told the kings seruants, and the hoste that was at Ierusalem, in the citie of Dauid, that certaine men, who had broken the kings commandement, were gone downe into the secret places in the wildernesse.
\v 32 They pursued after them, a great number, and hauing ouertaken them, they camped against them, and made war against them on the Sabbath day.
\v 33 And they said vnto them, Let that which you haue done hitherto, suffice: Come foorth, and doe according to the commandement of the king, and you shall liue.
\v 34 But they said, We will not come forth, neither will we do the kings commandement to profane the Sabbath day.
\v 35 \f + \fr 2:35 \ft Gr. the Iewes.\f*So then they gaue them the battell with all speed.
\v 36 Howbeit, they answered them not, neither cast they a stone at them, nor stopped the places where they lay hid,
\v 37 \f + \fr 2:37 \ft Gr. simplicitie.\f*But said, Let vs die all in our innocencie: heauen and earth shall testifie for vs, that you put vs to death wrongfully.
\v 38 \f + \fr 2:38 \ft Gr. soules of men.\f*So they rose vp against them in battell on the Sabbath, and they slew them with their wiues & children, and their cattell, to the number of a thousand people.
\v 39 Now when Mattathias and his friends vnderstood hereof, they mourned for them right sore.
\v 40 And one of them said to another: If we all do as our brethren haue done, and fight not for our liues, and lawes against the heathen, they wil now quickly root vs out of the earth.
\v 41 At that time therfore they decreed, saying, Whosoeuer shall come to make battell with vs on the Sabbath day, we will fight against him, neither will wee die all, as our brethren that were murdered in the secret places.
\v 42 Then came there vnto him a company of Assideans, who were mightie men of Israel, euen all such as were voluntarily deuoted vnto the Lawe.
\v 43 Also all they that fled for persecution ioyned themselues vnto them, and were a stay vnto them.
\v 44 So they ioyned their forces, and smote sinfull men in their anger, and wicked men in their wrath: but the rest fled to the heathen for succour.
\v 45 Then Mattathias & his friends went round about, and pulled downe the altars.
\v 46 \f + \fr 2:46 \ft Or, by force\f*And what children soeuer they found within the coast of Israel vncircumcised, those they circumcised valiantly.
\v 47 They pursued also after y\sup e\sup* proud men, & the work prospered in their hand.
\v 48 \f + \fr 2:48 \ft Gr. gaue they the horse to the sinner.\f*So they recouered the Law out of the hand of the Gentiles, and out of the hande of Kings, neither suffered they the sinner to triumph.
\v 49 Now when the time drew neere, that Mattathias should die, he said vnto his sonnes, Now hath pride & rebuke gotten strength, and the time of destruction, and the wrath of indignation:
\v 50 Now therefore, my sonnes, be ye zealous for the Law, & giue your liues for the couenant of your fathers.
\v 51 \f + \fr 2:51 \ft Gr. generations.\f*Call to remembrance what actes our fathers did in their time, so shall ye receiue great honour, & an euerlasting name.
\v 52 \x + \xo 2:52 \xt Gene.22 9, 10. rom. 43.\x*Was not Abraham found faithfull in tentation, and it was imputed vnto him for righteousnesse?
\v 53 \x + \xo 2:53 \xt Gene.41.40.\x*Ioseph in the time of his distresse kept the commaundement, and was made Lord of Egypt.
\v 54 \x + \xo 2:54 \xt Num.25.18. ecclus. 45.23.24.\x*Phineas our father in being zealous and feruent, obtained the couenant of an euerlasting priesthood.
\v 55 \x + \xo 2:55 \xt Iosh.1.2\x*Iesus for fulfilling the word, was made a iudge in Israel.
\v 56 \x + \xo 2:56 \xt Num.14.6.7. Iosh. 14.13.\x*Caleb for bearing witnesse, before the congregation, receiued the heritage of the land.
\v 57 \x + \xo 2:57 \xt 2.Sam. 2.4.\x*Dauid for being mercifull, possessed the throne of an euerlasting kingdome.
\v 58 \x + \xo 2:58 \xt 2 Kin. 2.11.\x*Elias for being zealous and feruent for the law, was taken vp into heauen.
\v 59 \x + \xo 2:59 \xt Dan 3.16.17.18, and 16.\x*Ananias, Azarias, and Misael, by beleeuing were saued out of the flame
\v 60 \x + \xo 2:60 \xt Dan.6.22.\x*Daniel for his innocencie was deliuered from the mouth of Lyons.
\v 61 And thus consider ye throughout all ages, that none that put their trust in him shall be ouercome.
\v 62 Feare not then the words of a sinfull man: for his glory shall bee dung and wormes.
\v 63 \x + \xo 2:63 \xt Psal.146.4.\x*To day he shall be lifted vp, and to morrow hee shall not be found, because he is returned into his dust, and his thought is come to nothing.
\v 64 Wherefore you my sonnes be valiant, and shew your selues men in the behalfe of the law, for by it shall you obtaine glory.
\v 65 And behold, I know that your brother Simon is a man of counsell, giue eare vnto him alway: he shall be a father vnto you.
\v 66 \f + \fr 2:66 \ft To fight yee the battaile of the people.\f*As for Iudas Maccabeus hee hath bin mighty and strong, euen from his youth vp, let him be your captaine, and fight the battaile of the people.
\v 67 Take also vnto you, all those that obserue the law, and auenge ye the wrong of your people.
\v 68 Recompence fully the heathen, and take heed to the commandements of the law.
\v 69 So he blessed them, and was gathered to his fathers.
\v 70 And he died in the hundreth fortie, and sixth yeere, and his sonnes buried him in the Sepulchre of his fathers, at Modin, and all Israel made great lamentation for him.
\c 3
\iex 1 The valour and fame of Iudas Maccabeus. 10 He ouerthroweth the forces of Samaria and Syria. 27 Antiochus sendeth a great power against him. 44 He and his fall to fasting and prayer, 58 and are encouraged.
\v 1 ¶ Then his sonne Iudas, called Maccabeus, rose vp in his stead.
\v 2 And all his brethren helped him, and so did all they that held with his father, and they fought with cheerefulnesse, the battaile of Israel.
\v 3 So he gate his people great honor, and put on a brestplate as a giant, and girt his warlike harnesse about him, and he made battels, protecting the host with his sword.
\v 4 In his acts he was like a lyon, and like a lyons whelp roaring for his pray.
\v 5 For hee pursued the wicked, and sought them out, and burnt vp those that vexed his people.
\v 6 Wherefore the wicked shrunke for feare of him, and all the workers of iniquity were troubled, because saluation prospered in his hand.
\v 7 He grieued also many kings, and made Iacob glad with his acts, and his memoriall is blessed for euer.
\v 8 Moreouer he went through the citties of Iuda, destroying the vngodly out of them, and turning away wrath from Israel.
\v 9 \f + \fr 3:9 \ft Gre. gathered together.\f*So that he was renowned vnto the vtmost part of the earth, & he receiued vnto him such as were ready to perish.
\v 10 Then Apollonius gathered the Gentiles together, and a great host out of Samaria to fight against Israel.
\v 11 Which thing when Iudas perceiued he went forth to meete him, and so he smote him, and slew him, many also fell downe slaine, but the rest fled.
\v 12 Wherefore Iudas tooke their spoiles, and Apollonius sword also, and therewith he fought, all his life long.
\v 13 Now when Seron a prince of the armie of Syria, heard say that Iudas had gathered vnto him a multitude and company of the faithfull, to goe out with him to warre.
\v 14 He said, I will get me a name and honour in the kingdome, for I will goe fight with Iudas, and them that are with him, who despise the kings commandement.
\v 15 So he made him ready to goe vp, and there went with him a mighty host of the vngodly to helpe him, and to be auenged of the children of Israel.
\v 16 And when hee came neere to the going vp of Bethoron, Iudas went forth to meet him with a smal company.
\v 17 Who when they saw the host comming to meet them, said vnto Iudas; How shall wee be able, being so few to fight against so great a multitude, and so strong, seeing wee are ready to faint with fasting all this day?
\v 18 \x + \xo 3:18 \xt 1.Sam.14.6. 2.Chron. 14.11.\x*Unto whom Iudas answered: It is no hard matter for many to bee shut vp in the hands of a few; and with the God of heauen it is all one, to deliuer with a great multitude, or a small company:
\v 19 For the victory of battell standeth not in the multitude of an hoste, but strength commeth from heauen.
\v 20 \f + \fr 3:20 \ft Or, vnto vs.\f*\f + \fr 3:20 \ft Greek in multitude of pride, or enuie, and iniquitie.\f*They come against vs in much pride and iniquitie to destroy vs, and our wiues & children, and to spoile vs:
\v 21 But wee fight for our liues, and our Lawes.
\v 22 Wherefore the Lord himselfe will ouerthrow them before our face: and as for you, be ye not afraid of them.
\v 23 Now as soone as hee had left off speaking, he lept suddenly vpon them, and so Seron and his host was ouerthrowen before him.
\v 24 \f + \fr 3:24 \ft Gr. in the going downe.\f*And they pursued them from the going downe of Bethoron, vnto the plaine, where were slaine about eight hundred men of them; and the residue fledde into the land of the Philistines.
\v 25 Then began the feare of Iudas and his brethren, & an exceeding great dread to fall vpon the nations round about them:
\v 26 In so much, as his fame came vnto the king, and all nations talked of the battels of Iudas.
\v 27 Now when King Antiochus heard these things, he was full of indignation: wherefore hee sent and gathered together all the forces of his realme [euen] a very strong armie.
\v 28 \f + \fr 3:28 \ft Gr. or at euery need.\f*He opened also his treasure, and gaue his souldiers pay for a yeere, commanding them to be ready, whensoeuer he should need them.
\v 29 \f + \fr 3:29 \ft Gr. that the collectors of tribute in the countrey were few.\f*\f + \fr 3:29 \ft Or, for the taking away of the Lawes\f*Neuerthelesse, when he saw that the money of his treasures failed, and that the tributes in the countrey were small, because of the dissention, and plague which he had brought vpon the land, in taking away the Lawes which had bene of old time,
\v 30 \f + \fr 3:30 \ft Gr. that he should not haue.\f*Hee feared that he should not be able to beare the charges any longer, nor to haue such gifts to giue so liberally, as he did before: for hee had abounded aboue the Kings that were before him.
\v 31 Wherefore, being greatly perplexed in his minde, hee determined to goe into Persia, there to take the tributes of the countreys, and to gather much money.
\v 32 So hee left Lysias a noble man, and one of the blood royall, to ouersee the affaires of the King, from the riuer Euphrates, vnto the borders of Egypt:
\v 33 And to bring vp his sonne Antiochus, vntill he came againe.
\v 34 Moreouer he deliuered vnto him the halfe of his forces, and the Elephants, and gaue him charge of all things that he would haue done, as also concerning them that dwelt in Iuda and Ierusalem.
\v 35 To wit, that he should send an armie against them, to destroy and root out the strength of Israel, and the remnant of Ierusalem, and to take away their memoriall from that place:
\v 36 And that he should place strangers in all their quarters, and diuide their land by lot.
\v 37 \f + \fr 3:37 \ft Gr. a citie of his kingdome.\f*So the king tooke the halfe of the forces that remained, and departed from Antioch his royall city, the hundreth fourtie and seuenth yeere, and hauing passed the riuer Euphrates, hee went through the high countreys.
\v 38 Then Lysias chose Ptoleme, the son of Dorymenes and Nicanor, & Gorgias, mighty men of the kings friends:
\v 39 And with them hee sent fourtie thousand footmen, and seuen thousand horsemen to goe into the land of Iuda, and to destroy it as the king cōmanded.
\v 40 So they went forth with all their power, and came and pitched by Emmaus in the plaine countrey.
\v 41 \f + \fr 3:41 \ft Or, fetters.\f*\f + \fr 3:41 \ft Or, of strangers.\f*And the merchants of the countrey, hearing the fame of them, tooke siluer, & gold very much, with seruants, and came into the campe to buy the children of Israel for slaues; A power also of Syria, and of the land of the Philistines, ioyned themselues vnto them.
\v 42 Now when Iudas and his brethren saw that miseries were multiplied, & that the forces did encampe themselues in their borders, (for they knewe how the king had giuen commaundement to destroy the people, and vtterly abolish them.)
\v 43 They said one to another, Let vs restore the decayed estate of our people, and let vs fight for our people and the Sanctuarie.
\v 44 Then was the Congregation gathered together, that they might be ready for battell, and that they might pray, and aske mercy and compassion.
\v 45 Now Ierusalem lay voide as a wildernesse, there was none of her children that went in or out: the Sanctuarie also was troden downe, and aliens kept the strong holde: the heathen had their habitation in that place, and ioy was taken from Iacob, and the pipe with the harpe ceased.
\v 46 \f + \fr 3:46 \ft Or, Muspa.\f*Wherefore the Israelites assembled themselues together, and came to Maspha ouer-against Ierusalem; for in Maspha was the place where they prayed aforetime in Israel.
\v 47 Then they fasted that day, and put on sackecloth, and cast ashes vpon their heads, and rent their clothes:
\v 48 \f + \fr 3:48 \ft Or, for the which the heathen had made diligent search that they might paint therein the likenesse of their idols.\f*And laide open the booke of the Law, wherein y\sup e\sup* heathen had sought to paint the likenesse of their images.
\v 49 \x + \xo 3:49 \xt Num.6.2.\x*They brought also the Priestes garments, and the first fruits, and the tithes, and the Nazarites they stirred vp, who had accomplished their dayes.
\v 50 Then cried they with a loud voice toward heauen, saying, What shall we doe with these, and whither shall wee cary them away?
\v 51 For thy Sanctuarie is troden downe and profaned, and thy Priestes are in heauinesse, and brought low.
\v 52 And loe, the heathen are assembled together against vs, to destroy vs: what things they imagine against vs, thou knowest.
\v 53 How shall wee be able to stand against them, except thou (O God) be our helpe?
\v 54 Then sounded they with trumpets, and cryed with a loude voice.
\v 55 And after this, Iudas ordained captains ouer the people, euen captains ouer thousands, and ouer hundreds, and ouer fifties, and ouer tennes.
\v 56 \x + \xo 3:56 \xt Deu.20.5.\x*\x + \xo 3:56 \xt Iudg.7.3.\x*But as for such as were building houses, or had betrothed wiues, or were planting vineyards, or were fearefull, those hee commanded that they should returne, euery man to his owne house, according to the Law.
\v 57 So the campe remooued, and pitched vpon the South side of Emmaus.
\v 58 And Iudas sayde, Arme your selues, and be valiant men, and see that ye be in readinesse against the morning, that yee may fight with these nations, that are assembled together against vs, to destroy vs and our Sanctuarie.
\v 59 For it is better for vs to die in battell, then to behold the calamities of our people, and our Sanctuarie.
\v 60 Neuerthelesse, as the will [of God] is in heauen, so let him doe.

\iex 6 Iudas defeateth the plot 14 and forces of Gorgias, 23 and spoileth their tents, 34 and ouerthroweth Lysias. 45 He pulleth downe the Altar which the heathen had prophaned, and setteth vp a newe, 60 and maketh a wall about Sion.
\v 1 ¶ Then tooke Gorgias fiue thousand footmen, and a thousand of the best horsemen, and remooued out of the campe by night:
\v 2 To the end he might rush in vpon the camp of the Iewes, and smite them suddenly. And the men of the fortresse were his guides.
\v 3 Now when Iudas heard thereof, hee himselfe remooued, and the valiant men with him, that hee might smite the Kings armie which was at Emmaus,
\v 4 While as yet the forces were dispersed from the campe.
\v 5 In the meane season came Gorgias by night into the campe of Iudas: and when hee found no man there, hee sought them in the mountaines: for said hee, these fellowes flee from vs.
\v 6 \f + \fr 4:6 \ft Or, targets.\f*But assoone as it was day, Iudas shewed himselfe in the plaine with three thousand men, who neuerthelesse had neither armour, nor swordes to their mindes.
\v 7 And they sawe the campe of the heathen, that it was strong, and well harnessed, and compassed round about with horsemen; and these were expert of warre.
\v 8 Then said Iudas to the men that were with him: feare ye not their multitude, neither be ye afraid of their assault
\v 9 Remember how our fathers were deliuered in the red Sea, when Pharao pursued them with an armie.
\v 10 Now therfore let vs crie vnto heauen, if peraduenture the Lord wil haue mercie vpon vs, and remember the couenant of our fathers, and destroy this hoste before our face this day.
\v 11 That so all the heathen may know that there is one, who deliuereth and saueth Israel.
\v 12 Then the strangers lift vp their eyes, & saw them comming ouer against them.
\v 13 Wherefore they went out of the campe to battell, but they that were with Iudas sounded their trumpets.
\v 14 So they ioyned battell, and the heathen being discomfited, fled into the plaine.
\v 15 Howbeit all the hindmost of them were slaine with the sword: for they pursued them vnto Gazera, and vnto the plaines of Idumea, and Azotus, and Iamnia, so that there were slaine of them, vpon a three thousand men.
\v 16 This done, Iudas returned againe with his hoste frō pursuing them,
\v 17 And said to the people, Bee not greedie of the spoiles, in as much as there is a battell before vs,
\v 18 And Gorgias and his hoste are here by vs in the mountaine, but stand ye now against your enemies, and ouercome them, & after this you may boldly take the spoiles.
\v 19 As Iudas was yet speaking these words, there appeared apart of them looking out of the mountaine.
\v 20 Who when they perceiued that the Iewes had put their hoste to flight, and were burning the tents: (for the smoke that was seene declared what was done)
\v 21 When therefore they perceiued these things, they were sore afraid, and seeing also the hoste of Iudas in the plaine ready to fight:
\v 22 They fled euery one into the land of strangers.
\v 23 Then Iudas returned to spoile the tents, where they got much golde, and siluer, and blew silke, and purple of the sea, and great riches.
\v 24 After this, they went home, and sung a song of thankesgiuing, & praised the Lord in heauen: because it is good, because his mercie endureth for euer.
\v 25 Thus Israel had a great deliuerance that day.
\v 26 Now all the strangers that had escaped, came and told Lysias what had happened.
\v 27 Who when hee heard thereof, was confounded, and discouraged, because neither such things as he would, were done vnto Israel, nor such things as the king commanded him were come to passe.
\v 28 The next yeere therefore following, Lysias gathered together threescore thousand choice men of foote, and fiue thousand horsemen, that he might subdue them.
\v 29 So they came into Idumea, and pitched their tents at Bethsura, and Iudas met with them ten thousand men.
\v 30 \x + \xo 4:30 \xt 1.Sam.17 50,51.\x*\f + \fr 4:30 \ft Or, Philistines,\f*\x + \xo 4:30 \xt 1.Sam.14 13,14.\x*And when he saw that mighty armie, he prayed, and said, Blessed art thou, O sauiour of Israel, who diddest quaile the violence of the mighty man by the hand of thy seruant Dauid, and gauest, the host of strangers into the hands of Ionathan the sonne of Saul, and his armour bearer.
\v 31 Shut vp this armie in the hand of thy people Israel, and let them be confounded in their power and horsemen.
\v 32 \f + \fr 4:32 \ft Gr. melt.\f*Make them to be of no courage, and cause the boldnesse of their strength to fall away, & let them quake at their destruction.
\v 33 Cast them downe with the sword of them that loue thee, and let all those that know thy name, praise thee with thanksgiuing.
\v 34 So they ioyned battaile, and there were slaine of the host of Lysias about fiue thousand men, euen before them were they slaine.
\v 35 Now when Lysias saw his armie put to flight, and the manlinesse of Iudas souldiers, and how they were ready, either to liue or die valiantly, he went into Antiochia, and gathered together a company of strangers, and hauing made his armie greater then it was, he purposed to come againe into Iudea.
\v 36 \f + \fr 4:36 \ft Or, repaire\f*Then saide Iudas and his brethren, behold our enemies are discomfited: let vs goe vp to cleanse, and dedicate the Sanctuarie.
\v 37 Upon this all the host assembled themselues together, and went vp into mount Sion.
\v 38 And when they saw the sanctuarie desolate, and the altar prophaned, and the gates burnt vp, and shrubs growing in the courts, as in a forrest, or in one of the mountaines, yea and the priests chambers pulled downe,
\v 39 They rent their clothes, and made great lamentation, and cast ashes vpon their heads,
\v 40 And fell downe flat to the ground vpon their faces, and blew an alarme with the trumpets, and cried towards heauen.
\v 41 Then Iudas appointed certaine men to fight against those that were in the fortresse, vntill he had clensed the Sanctuarie.
\v 42 So he chose priests of blamelesse conuersation, such as had pleasure in the law.
\v 43 Who cleansed the Sanctuarie, and bare out the defiled stones into an vncleane place.
\v 44 And when as they consulted what to doe with the altar of burnt offrings which was prophaned,
\v 45 They thought it best to pull it downe, lest it should be a reproch to them, because the heathen had defiled it; wherefore they pulled it downe,
\v 46 And laide vp the stones in the mountaine of the temple in a conuenient place, vntill there should come a Prophet, to shew what should be done with them.
\v 47 \x + \xo 4:47 \xt Exod. 20 25. deut 27 5, & Iosh. 8.\x*Then they tooke whole stones according to the law, and built a new altar, according to the former:
\v 48 And made vp the Sanctuarie, and the things that were within the temple, and hallowed the courts.
\v 49 They made also new holy vessels, and into the temple they brought the candlesticke, and the altar of burnt offerings, and of incense, and the table.
\v 50 And vpon the altar they burnt incense, and the lamps that were vpon the candlesticke they lighted, that they might giue light in the temple.
\v 51 \f + \fr 4:51 \ft Or, spread abroad the hangings, or hanged vp the uailes.\f*Furthermore they set the loaues vpon the table, and spread out the veiles, and finished all the workes which they had begunne to make.
\v 52 Now on the fiue and twentieth day of the ninth moneth, (which is called the moneth Casleu) in the hundreth fourty and eight yeere they rose vp betimes in the morning,
\v 53 And offered sacrifice according to the law vpon the new altar of burnt offerings, which they had made.
\v 54 Looke at what time, and what day the heathen had prophaned it, euen in that was it dedicated with songs, and cittherns, and harpes, & cimbals.
\v 55 Then all the people fell vpon their faces, worshipping and praising the God of heauen, who had giuen them good successe.
\v 56 \f + \fr 4:56 \ft Or, peace offerings.\f*And so they kept the dedication of the altar eight dayes, and offered burnt offerings with gladnesse, and sacrificed the sacrifice of deliuerance and praise.
\v 57 \f + \fr 4:57 \ft Or, dedicated.\f*\f + \fr 4:57 \ft Or, made doores for them.\f*They deckt also the forefront of the temple with crownes of gold; and with shields, and the gates, and the chambers they renewed and hanged doores vpon them.
\v 58 Thus was there very great gladnesse among the people, for that the reproch of the heathen was put away.
\v 59 Moreouer Iudas and his brethren with the whole congregation of Israel ordained that the daies of the dedication of the altar, should be kept in their season from yeere to yeere by the space of eight dayes, from the fiue and twentieth day of the moneth Casleu, with mirth and gladnesse.
\v 60 At that time also they builded vp the mount Sion with high walles, and strong towres round about, lest the Gentiles should come & tread it downe, as they had done before.
\v 61 And they set there a garison to keepe it: and fortified Bethsura to preserue it, that the people might haue a defence against Idumea.

\iex 3 Iudas smiteth the children of Dan, Bean, and Ammon. 17 Simon is sent into Galile. 15 The exploits of Iudas in Galaad. 51 He destroyeth Ephron, for denying him to passe through it. 56 Diuerse, that in Iudas absence would fight with their enemies, are slaine.
\v 1 ¶ Now when the nations round about heard that the Altar was built, & the Sanctuarie renewed as before, it displeased them very much.
\v 2 Wherfore they thought to destroy the generation of Iacob that was among them, and thereupon they began to slay and destroy the people.
\v 3 \f + \fr 5:3 \ft Or, Arabathene, or Arabattan, or Arabestins.\f*Then Iudas fought against the children of Esau in Idumea at Arabattine, because they besieged Israel: and hee gaue them a great ouerthrow, and abated their courage, and tooke their spoiles.
\v 4 \f + \fr 5:4 \ft Or, malice.\f*\x + \xo 5:4 \xt Or, Haran, Gene. 36.27. & num. 33.3,32.\x*Also he remembred the iniurie of the children of Bean, who had bene a snare and an offence vnto the people, in that they lay in waite for them in the wayes.
\v 5 Hee shut them vp therefore in the towres, and incamped against them, and destroyed them vtterly, and burnt the towers of that place with fire, and all that were therein.
\v 6 Afterward he passed ouer to the children of Ammon, where he found a mighty power, and much people, with Timotheus their captaine.
\v 7 So he fought many battels with them, till at length they were discomfited before him; and he smote them.
\v 8 And when hee had taken Iazar, with the townes belonging thereto, he returned into Iudea.
\v 9 Then the heathen that were at Galead, assembled themselues together against the Israelites that were in their quarters to destroy them: but they fled to the fortresse of Dathema;
\v 10 And sent letters vnto Iudas and his brethren: The heathen that are round about vs, are assembled together against vs to destroy vs;
\v 11 And they are preparing to come and take the fortresse whereunto wee are fled, Timotheus being captaine of their host.
\v 12 Come now therefore and deliuer vs from their handes, for many of vs are slaine.
\v 13 Yea all our brethren that were in the places of Tobie, are put to death, their wiues and their children; Also they haue caried away captiues, and borne away their stuffe, and they haue destroied there about a thousand men.
\v 14 While these letters were yet reading, behold there came other messengers from Galilee with their clothes rent, who reported on this wise,
\v 15 And said: They of Ptolemais, and of Tyrus, and Sidon, and all Galilee of the Gentiles are assembled together against vs to consume vs.
\v 16 Now when Iudas and the people heard these wordes, there assembled a great congregation together, to consult what they should doe for their brethren, that were in trouble and assaulted of them.
\v 17 Then said Iudas vnto Simon his brother, Choose thee out men, and goe, and deliuer thy brethren that are in Galilee, for I and Ionathan my brother, will goe into the countrey of Galaad.
\v 18 So hee left Ioseph the sonne of Zacharias, and Azarias captaines of the people, with the remnant of the hoste in Iudea to keepe it,
\v 19 Unto whom he gaue commandement, saying, Take yee the charge of this people, and see that you make not warre against the heathen, vntill the time that we come againe.
\v 20 Now vnto Simon were giuen three thousand men to goe into Galilee, and vnto Iudas eight thousand men for the countrey of Galaad.
\v 21 Then went Simon into Galilee, where hee fought many battels with the heathen, so that the heathen were discomfited by him.
\v 22 And hee pursued them vnto the gate of Ptolemais; And there were slaine of the heathen about three thousand men, whose spoiles he tooke.
\v 23 \f + \fr 5:23 \ft Or, captiue Iewes.\f*And those that were in Galilee and in Arbattis, with their wiues and their children, and all that they had, tooke he away [with him] and brought them into Iudea, with great ioy.
\v 24 Iudas Maccabeus also and his brother Ionathan, went ouer Iordan, and trauailed three dayes iourney in the wildernesse,
\v 25 Where they met with the Nabathites, who came vnto them in peaceable maner, and told them euery thing that had happened to their brethren in the land of Galaad,
\v 26 \f + \fr 5:26 \ft Or, Bosora.\f*\f + \fr 5:26 \ft Or, Chascor.\f*And how that many of them were shut vp in Bosora, and Bosor, in Alema, Casphor, Maked & Carnaim (all these cities are strong and great.)
\v 27 \f + \fr 5:27 \ft Or, the heathen.\f*And that they were shut vp in the rest of the cities of the countrey of Galaad, and that against to morrow they had appointed to bring their host against the forts, and to take them, and to destroy them all in one day.
\v 28 \f + \fr 5:28 \ft Or, Bosor.\f*Hereupon Iudas and his host turned suddenly by the way of the wildernesse vnto Bosorra, and when he had wonne the citie, hee slew all the males with the edge of the sword, and tooke all their spoiles, and burnt the citie with fire.
\v 29 From whence hee remooued by night, and went till he came to the fortresse.
\v 30 \f + \fr 5:30 \ft Gr. lift vp their eyes.\f*\f + \fr 5:30 \ft The heathen assaulted the Iewes.\f*And betimes in the morning they looked vp, & behold, there was an innumerable people bearing ladders, and other engines of warre, to take the fortresse: for they assaulted them.
\v 31 When Iudas therefore saw that the battaile was begun, and that the cry of the citie went vp to heauen, with trumpets, and a great sound,
\v 32 He said vnto his hoste, Fight this day for your brethren.
\v 33 So he went foorth behinde them in three companies, who sounded their trumpets, and cryed with prayer.
\v 34 Then the hoste of Timotheus knowing that it was Maccabeus, fled from him: wherefore hee smote them with a great slaughter: so that there were killed of them that day about eight thousand men.
\v 35 This done, Iudas turned aside to Maspha, and after he had assaulted it, hee tooke it, and slewe all the males therein, and receiued the spoiles therof, and burnt it with fire.
\v 36 From thence went he, and tooke Casphon, Maged, Bosor, and the other cities of the countrey of Galaad.
\v 37 After these things, gathered Timotheus another hoste, and encamped against Raphon beyond the brooke.
\v 38 So Iudas sent [men] to espie the hoste, who brought him word, saying; All the heathen that be round about vs, are assembled vnto them, euen a very great hoste.
\v 39 Hee hath also hired the Arabians to helpe them, and they haue pitched their tents beyond the brooke, readie to come and fight against thee: vpon this Iudas went to meet them.
\v 40 Then Timotheus said vnto the captaines of his hoste, When Iudas and his hoste come neere the brooke, if he passe ouer first vnto vs, we shall not be able to withstand him, for hee will mightily preuaile against vs.
\v 41 But if he be afraid, and campe beyond the riuer, we shall goe ouer vnto him, and preuaile against him.
\v 42 Now when Iudas came neere the brooke, he caused the Scribes of the people to remaine by the brooke: vnto whom hee gaue commandement, saying, Suffer no man to remaine in the campe, but let all come to the battell.
\v 43 So he went first ouer vnto them, and all the people after him: then all the heathen being discomfited before him, cast away their weapons, and fled vnto the Temple that was at Carnaim.
\v 44 \f + \fr 5:44 \ft Iudas and his company.\f*But they tooke the citie, and burnt the Temple, with all that were therein. Thus was Carnaim subdued, neither could they stand any longer before Iudas.
\v 45 Then Iudas gathered together all the Israelites that were in the countrey of Galaad from the least vnto the greatest, euen their wiues and their children, and their stuffe, a very great hoste, to the ende they might come into the land of Iudea.
\v 46 Now when they came vnto Ephron (this was a great city in the way as they should goe, very well fortified) they could not turne from it, either on the right hand or the left, but must needs passe through the midst of it.
\v 47 Then they of the city shut them out, and stopped vp the gates with stones.
\v 48 Whereupon Iudas sent vnto them in peaceable maner, saying; Let vs passe through your land to goe into our owne countrey, and none shall doe you any hurt, we will onely passe thorow on foote: howbeit they would not open vnto him.
\v 49 Wherefore Iudas commaunded a proclamation to be made throughout the hoste, that euery man should pitch his tent in the place where he was.
\v 50 So the souldiers pitched, and assaulted the city all that day, and all that night, till at the length the city was deliuered into his hands:
\v 51 Who then slew all the males with the edge of the sword, and rased the city, and tooke the spoiles therof, and passed through the city ouer them that were slaine.
\v 52 After this went they ouer Iordan, into the great plaine before Bethsan.
\v 53 \x + \xo 5:53 \xt Or, went hindmost, Num. 10.25\x*\f + \fr 5:53 \ft Or, comforted, or encouraged.\f*And Iudas gathered together those that came behind, and exhorted the people all the way through, till they came into the land of Iudea.
\v 54 \x + \xo 5:54 \xt Peace offerings, Ioseph. Antiq. 12.12.\x*So they went vp to mount Sion with ioy and gladnesse, where they offered burnt offerings, because not one of them were slaine, vntill they had returned in peace.
\v 55 Now what time as Iudas and Ionathan were in the land of Galaad, and Simon his brother in Galilee before Ptolemais,
\v 56 Ioseph the sonne of Zacharias, and Azarias, captaines of the garisons, heard of the valiant actes and warlike deeds which they had done.
\v 57 Wherefore they said, Let vs also get vs a name, and goe fight against the heathen that are round about vs.
\v 58 So when they had giuen charge vnto the garison that was with them, they went towards Iamnia.
\v 59 \f + \fr 5:59 \ft Gr. to meet them in battell.\f*Then came Gorgias and his men out of the citie to fight against them.
\v 60 And so it was, that Ioseph and Azarias were put to flight, and pursued vnto the borders of Iudea, and there were slaine that day of the people of Israel about two thousand men.
\v 61 Thus was there a great ouerthrow among the children of Israel, because they were not obedient vnto Iudas, and his brethren, but thought to doe some valiant act.
\v 62 Moreouer these men came not of the seed of those, by whose hand deliuerance was giuen vnto Israel.
\v 63 Howbeit the man Iudas and his brethren were greatly renowned in the sight of all Israel, and of all the heathen wheresoeuer their name was heard of,
\v 64 Insomuch as the people assembled vnto them with ioyfull acclamations.
\v 65 \f + \fr 5:65 \ft Gr. daughters.\f*Afterward went Iudas foorth with his brethren, and fought against the children of Esau in the land toward the South, where he smote Hebron, and the townes thereof, and pulled downe the fortresse of it, and burnt the townes thereof round about.
\v 66 \f + \fr 5:66 \ft Gr. strangers.\f*From thence he remoued to goe into the land of the Philistines, and passed through Samaria.
\v 67 At that time certaine priests desirous to shew their valour, were slaine in battell, for that they went out to fight vnaduisedly.
\v 68 So Iudas turned to Azotus in the land of the Philistines, and when he had pulled downe their altars, and burnt their carued images with fire, and spoiled their cities, he returned into the land of Iudea.
\c 6
\iex 8 Antiochus dieth, 12 and confesseth that he is plagued for the wrong done to Ierusalem. 20 Iudas besiegeth those in the towre at Hierusalem. 28 They procure Antiochus the yonger to come into Iudea. 51 He besiegeth Sion, 60 and maketh peace with Israel: 62 yet ouerthroweth the wall of Sion.
\v 1 ¶ About that time king Antiochus trauailing through the high countreys, heard say that Elimais in the countrey of Persia, was a citie greatly renowned for riches, siluer, and gold,
\v 2 \f + \fr 6:2 \ft Or, shields.\f*\f + \fr 6:2 \ft Or, armour\f*And that there was in it a very rich temple, wherein were couerings of gold, and brestplates, and shields which Alexander sonne of Philippe the Macedonian King, who reigned first among the Grecians, had left there.
\v 3 Wherefore he came and sought to take the citie, and to spoile it, but he was not able, because they of the citie hauing had warning thereof,
\v 4 Rose vp against him in battell: So he fled and departed thence with great heauinesse, and returned to Babylon.
\v 5 Moreouer there came one, who brought in tidings into Persia, that the armies which went against the land of Iudea, were put to flight:
\v 6 And that Lysias who went forth first with a great power, was driuen away of the Iewes, and that they were made strong by the armour, and power, and store of spoiles, which they had gotten of the armies, whom they had destroyed.
\v 7 Also that they had pulled downe the abomination which hee had set vp vpon the altar in Ierusalem, and that they had compassed about the Sanctuarie with high wals as before, and his citie Bethsura.
\v 8 Now when the king heard these words, he was astonished, and sore moued, whereupon hee laide him downe vpon his bedde, and fell sicke for griefe, because it had not befallen him, as hee looked for.
\v 9 And there hee continued many dayes: for his griefe was euer more and more, and he made account that he should die.
\v 10 Wherefore he called for all his friends, and said vnto them, The sleepe is gone from mine eyes, and my heart faileth for very care.
\v 11 And I thought with my selfe: Into what tribulation am I come, and how great a flood [of miserie] is it wherein now I am? for I was bountifull, and beloued in my power.
\v 12 But now I remember the euils that I did at Ierusalem, and that I tooke all the vessels of gold and siluer that were therein, and sent to destroy the inhabitants of Iudea without a cause.
\v 13 I perceiue therefore that for this cause these troubles are come vpon me, and behold I perish through great griefe in a strange land.
\v 14 Then called he for Philip one of his friends whom he made ruler ouer all his realme:
\v 15 \f + \fr 6:15 \ft Or, hee should take his sonne Antiochus to him.\f*And gaue him the crowne and his robe, and his signet, to the end hee should bring vp his sonne Antiochus, and nourish him vp for the kingdome.
\v 16 So king Antiochus died there in the hundreth forty and ninth yeere.
\v 17 Now when Lysias knew that the king was dead, he set vp Antiochus his sonne (whom he had brought vp being yong) to reigne in his stead, and his name he called Eupator.
\v 18 About this time they that were in the towre shut vp the Israelites round about the Sanctuarie, and sought alwayes their hurt, and the strengthening of the heathen.
\v 19 Wherefore Iudas purposing to destroy them, called all the people together to besiege them.
\v 20 So they came together, and besieged them in the hundred and fiftith yeere, and he made mounts for shot against them, and [other] engines:
\v 21 Howbeit certaine of them that were besieged got forth, vnto whom some vngodly men of Israel ioyned themselues.
\v 22 And they went vnto the king and said, How long will it be ere thou execute iudgement, and auenge our brethren?
\v 23 We haue beene willing to serue thy father, and to doe as he would haue vs, and to obey his commandements.
\v 24 For which cause they of our nation besiege the towre, and are alienated from vs: Moreouer as many of vs as they could light on, they slew, and spoiled our inheritance.
\v 25 Neither haue they stretched out their hand against vs only, but also against all their borders.
\v 26 And behold this day are they besieging the towre at Ierusalem to take it: the Sanctuary also, and Bethsura haue they fortified.
\v 27 Wherefore if thou doest not preuent them quickly, they wil doe greater things then these, neither shalt thou be able to rule them.
\v 28 Now when the king heard this, he was angry, and gathered together all his friends, and the captaines of his armie, and those that had charge of the horse.
\v 29 There came also vnto him from other kingdomes, and from Isles of the Sea bands of hired souldiers.
\v 30 So that the number of his armie was an hundred thousand foote men, and twentie thousand horsemen, and two and thirty Elephants exercised in battell.
\v 31 These went through Idumea, and pitched against Bethsura which they assaulted many daies, making engines of warre: but they [of Bethsura] came out, and burnt them with fire, and fought valiantly.
\v 32 Upon this Iudas remoued from the towre, and pitched in Bathzacharias, ouer against the kings campe.
\v 33 Then the king rising very earely marched fiercely with his host toward Bathzacharias, where his armies made them ready to battell, and sounded the trumpets.
\v 34 And to the end they might prouoke the elephants to fight, they shewed them the blood of grapes & mulberies.
\v 35 Moreouer, they diuided the beasts among the armies, and for euery elephant they appointed a thousand men, armed with coats of male, and with helmets of brasse on their heads, and besides this, for euery beast were ordained fiue hundred horsemen of the best.
\v 36 These were ready at euery occasion: wheresoeuer the beast was, and whithersoeuer y\sup e\sup* beast went, they went also, neither departed they from him.
\v 37 And vpon the beastes were there strong towres of wood, which couered euery one of them, and were girt fast vnto them with deuices: there were also vpon euery one two and thirtie strong men that fought vpon them, besides the Indian that ruled him.
\v 38 \f + \fr 6:38 \ft Or, stirring them vp, and being compassed with the ranckes, or defended with the valleys.\f*As for the remnant of the horsemen they set them on this side, and that side, at the two parts of the host giuing them signes what to do, and being harnessed all ouer amidst the rankes.
\v 39 Now when the Sunne shone vpon the shields of golde, and brasse, the mountaines glistered therewith, and shined like lampes of fire.
\v 40 So part of the kings armie being spred vpon the high mountaines, and part on the valleyes below, they marched on safely, and in order.
\v 41 Wherefore all that heard the noise of their multitude, and the marching of the company, and the ratling of the harnesse, were moued: for the army was very great and mighty.
\v 42 Then Iudas and his host drew neere, and entred into battell, and there were slaine of the kings army, sixe hundred men.
\v 43 ¶ Eleazar also (syrnamed) Sauaran, perceiuing that one of the beasts, armed with royall harnesse, was higher then all the rest, and supposing that the king was vpon him,
\v 44 Put himselfe in ieopardie, to the end hee might deliuer his people, and get him a perpetuall name:
\v 45 \f + \fr 6:45 \ft Or, so that he cut them in pieces.\f*Wherefore hee ranne vpon him courageously through the midst of the battell, slaying on the right hand, and on the left, so that they were diuided from him on both sides.
\v 46 Which done, he crept vnder the Elephant, and thrust him vnder and slew him: whereupon the Elephant fell downe vpon him, and there he died.
\v 47 How be it [the rest of the Iewes] seeing the strength of the king, and the violence of his forces, turned away from them.
\v 48 ¶ \f + \fr 6:48 \ft Or, in Iudea.\f*Then the kings armie went vp to Ierusalem to meet them, and the king pitched his tents against Iudea, and against mount Sion.
\v 49 \f + \fr 6:49 \ft Adde out of Iosephus, and yeelded themselues.\f*But with them that were in Bethsura hee made peace: for they came out of the citie, because they had no victuals there, to endure the siege, it being a yeere of rest to the land.
\v 50 So the King tooke Bethsura, and set a garison there to keepe it.
\v 51 \f + \fr 6:51 \ft Or, made there mounts for shot.\f*As for the Sanctuarie hee besieged it many dayes: and set there artillerie with engins, and instruments to cast fire and stones, and pieces to cast darts, and slings.
\v 52 \f + \fr 6:52 \ft Or, the Iewes.\f*Whereupon they also made engins, against their engins, and helde them battell a long season.
\v 53 Yet at the last their vessels being without victuals, (for that it was the seuenth yeere, and they in Iudea that were deliuered from the Gentiles, had eaten vp the residue of the store)
\v 54 There were but a few left in the Sanctuary, because the famine did so preuaile against them, that they were faine to disperse themselues, euery man to his owne place.
\v 55 At that time Lysias heard say, that Philip (whom Antiochus the King whiles hee liued had appointed to bring vp his sonne Antiochus, that he might be king)
\v 56 Was returned out of Persia, and Media, and the Kings host also that went with him, and that hee sought to take vnto him the ruling of the affaires.
\v 57 Wherefore hee went in all haste, and said to the King, and the captaines of the host, and the company, Wee decay dayly, and our victuals are but small, and the place wee lay siege vnto is strong: and the affaires of the kingdome lie vpon vs.
\v 58 \f + \fr 6:58 \ft Gr. giue hands.\f*Now therefore let vs be friends with these men, and make peace with them, and with all their nation.
\v 59 And couenant with them, that they shall liue after their Lawes, as they did before: for they are therefore displeased, & haue done all these things because wee abolished their Lawes.
\v 60 So the King and the Princes were content: wherefore hee sent vnto them to make peace, and they accepted thereof.
\v 61 Also the King and the Princes made an oath vnto them: whereupon they went out of the strong hold.
\v 62 Then the King entred into mount Sion, but when hee saw the strength of the place, hee brake his oath that hee had made, and gaue commandement to pull downe the wall round about.
\v 63 Afterward departed hee in all haste, and returned vnto Antiochia, where hee found Philip to bee master of the citie; So he fought against him, and tooke the citie by force.

\iex 1 Antiochus is slaine, and Demetrius reigneth in his stead. 5 Alcimus would be hie Priest, and complaineth of Iudas to the king. 16 He slayeth threescore Asideans. 43 Nicanor is slaine, and the kings forces are defeated by Iudas. 49 The day of this victorie is kept holy euery yeere.
\v 1 ¶ \f + \fr 7:1 \ft Tripolis: Ioseph. Ant. lib.10,12. cap.16.\f*In the hundreth and one and fiftieth yeere, Demetrius the sonne of Seleucus departed from Rome, and came vp with a fewe men vnto a citie of the Sea coast, and reigned there.
\v 2 \f + \fr 7:2 \ft Gr. house of the kingdome of his father.\f*And as he entred into the palace of his ancestors, so it was, that his forces had taken Antiochus and Lysias to bring them vnto him.
\v 3 Wherefore when he knew it, hee said; Let me not see their faces.
\v 4 So his hoste slewe them. Now when Demetrius was set vpon the throne of his kingdome,
\v 5 There came vnto him all the wicked and vngodly men of Israel, hauing Alcimus (who was desirous to be high Priest) for their captaine.
\v 6 And they accused the people to the king, saying; Iudas and his brethren haue slaine all thy friends, and driuen vs out of our owne land.
\v 7 Now therefore send some man whom thou trustest, and let him goe and see what hauocke he hath made amongst vs, and in the kings land, and let him punish them with all them that aide them.
\v 8 Then the king chose Bacchides a friend of the king, who ruled beyond the flood, and was a great man in the kingdome, and faithfull to the king.
\v 9 And him hee sent with that wicked Alcimus, whom hee made high Priest, and commanded that he should take vengeance of the children of Israel.
\v 10 So they departed, and came with a great power into the land of Iudea, where they sent messengers to Iudas and his brethren with peaceable words deceitfully.
\v 11 But they gaue no heede to their words, for they sawe that they were come with a great power.
\v 12 \f + \fr 7:12 \ft Or, officers. gouernment, chiefemen, or men in aythoritie.\f*Then did there assemble vnto Alcimus and Bacchides, a company of Scribes, to require iustice.
\v 13 Now the Assideans were the first among the children of Israel, that sought peace of them:
\v 14 For, said they, one that is a Priest of the seede of Aaron, is come with this armie, and he will doe vs no wrong.
\v 15 So he spake vnto them peaceably, and sware vnto them, saying; We will procure the harme neither of you nor your friends.
\v 16 Whereupon they beleeued him: howbeit hee tooke of them threescore men, and slewe them in one day, according to the words which he wrote:
\v 17 \x + \xo 7:17 \xt Psal.79.2,3.\x*The flesh of thy Saints [haue they cast out] and their blood haue they shed round about Ierusalem, and there was none to bury them.
\v 18 \f + \fr 7:18 \ft Gr. iudgement.\f*Wherefore the feare and dread of them fell vpon all the people, who said, There is neither trueth, nor righteousnesse in them; for they haue broken the couenant and othe that they made.
\v 19 After this remooued Bacchides from Ierusalem, and pitched his tents in Bezeth, where he sent and tooke many of the men that had forsaken him, and certaine of the people also, and when he had slaine them, [he cast them] into the great pit.
\v 20 Then committed he the countrey to Alcimus, and left with him a power to aide him: so Bacchides went vnto the king.
\v 21 \f + \fr 7:21 \ft Or, laboured to defend his high Priesthood.\f*But Alcimus contended for the high Priesthood.
\v 22 And vnto him resorted all such as troubled the people, who after they had gotten the land of Iuda into their power, did much hurt in Israel.
\v 23 Now when Iudas saw all the mischiefe that Alcimus and his company had done among the Israelites, euen aboue the heathen,
\v 24 \f + \fr 7:24 \ft Or, fledde from him to the enemie.\f*\f + \fr 7:24 \ft Or, inuade the countrey.\f*He went out into all the coast of Iudea round about, and tooke vengeance of them that had reuolted from him, so that they durst no more goe foorth into the countrey.
\v 25 \f + \fr 7:25 \ft Or, were growen very strong.\f*\f + \fr 7:25 \ft Gr. to abide them.\f*On the other side, when Alcimus saw that Iudas and his company had gotten the vpper hand, and knew that he was not able to abide their force, he went againe to the king, and said all the worst of them that he could.
\v 26 Then the king sent Nicanor one of his honourable princes, a man that bare deadly hate vnto Israel, with commandement to destroy the people.
\v 27 \f + \fr 7:27 \ft Gr. peaceable.\f*So Nicanor came to Ierusalem with a great force: and sent vnto Iudas and his brethren deceitfully with friendly words, saying,
\v 28 \f + \fr 7:28 \ft Gr. see your faces.\f*Let there be no battell betweene me and you, I will come with a fewe men, that I may see you in peace.
\v 29 He came therefore to Iudas, and they saluted one another peaceably. Howbeit the enemies were prepared to take away Iudas by violence.
\v 30 Which thing after it was knowen to Iudas (to wit) that he came vnto him with deceit, he was sore afraid of him, and would see his face no more.
\v 31 \f + \fr 7:31 \ft Gr. meet Iudas in battell.\f*\f + \fr 7:31 \ft Or, Carphasalama.\f*Nicanor also when he saw that his counsell was discouered, went out to fight against Iudas besides Capharsalama.
\v 32 Where there were slaine of Nicanors side, about fiue thousand men, and [the rest] fled into the citie of Dauid.
\v 33 After this went Nicanor vp to mount Sion, and there came out of the Sanctuarie certaine of the priestes, and certaine of the elders of the people to salute him peaceably, and to shewe him the burnt sacrifice that was offred for the king.
\v 34 \f + \fr 7:34 \ft Gr. defiled them.\f*But he mocked them, and laughed at them, and abused them shamefully, and spake proudly,
\v 35 \f + \fr 7:35 \ft Gr. in peace\f*And swore in his wrath, saying, vnlesse Iudas and his hoste be now deliuered into my hands, if euer I come againe in safetie, I will burne vp this house: and with that he went out in a great rage.
\v 36 Then the priests entred in, and stood before the altar, and the Temple, weeping, and saying,
\v 37 Thou O Lord didst choose this house, to be called by thy Name, and to be a house of prayer and petition for thy people.
\v 38 Be auenged of this man and his hoste, and let them fall by the sword: Remember their blasphemies, and suffer them not to continue any longer.
\v 39 So Nicanor went out of Ierusalem, & pitched his tents in Bethoron, where an hoste out of Syria met him.
\v 40 But Iudas pitched in Adasa with three thousand men, and there he prayed, saying,
\v 41 \x + \xo 7:41 \xt 2.Kings 19.35. esai. 37.36. ecclus.48.22. 2.mac.8.19\x*O Lord, when they that were sent from the king of the Assyrians blasphemed, thine Angel went out, and smote a hundred, fourescore, and fiue thousand of them.
\v 42 Euen so destroy thou this host before vs this day, that the rest may know that he hath spoken blasphemously against thy Sanctuary, and iudge thou him according to his wickednesse.
\v 43 So the thirteenth day of the moneth Adar, the hostes ioyned battell, but Nicanors host was discomfited, & he himselfe was first slaine in the battell.
\v 44 Now when Nicanors host saw that he was slaine, they cast away their weapons, and fled.
\v 45 \f + \fr 7:45 \ft Or, the Iewes,\f*Then they pursued after them a dayes iourney from Adasa, vnto Gasera, sounding an alarme after them with their trumpets.
\v 46 Whereupon they came forth out of all the townes of Iudea round about, and closed them in, so that they turning backe vpon them that pursued them, were all slaine with the sword, and not one of them was left.
\v 47 Afterwards they tooke y\sup e\sup* spoiles, and the pray, and smote off Nicanors head, & his right hand, which he stretched out so proudly, and brought them away; and hanged them vp, towards Ierusalem.
\v 48 For this cause the people reioyced greatly, and they kept that day, a day of great gladnesse.
\v 49 Moreouer they ordeined to keepe yeerely this day, being the thirteenth of Adar.
\v 50 Thus the land of Iuda was in rest a litle while.

\iex 1 Iudas is informed of the power and policie of the Romanes, 20 and maketh a league with them. 24 The articles of that league.
\v 1 ¶ Now Iudas had heard of the fame of the Romanes, that they were mighty and valiant men, and such as would louingly accept all that ioyned themselues vnto them, and make a league of amitie with all that came vnto them,
\v 2 \f + \fr 8:2 \ft Or, French men.\f*And that they were men of great valour: It was told him also of their warres and noble acts which they had done amongst the Galatians, and how they had conquered them, and brought them vnder tribute.
\v 3 And what they had done in y\sup e\sup* countrey of Spaine, for the winning of the mines of the siluer & gold which is there
\v 4 \f + \fr 8:4 \ft Or, euery place.\f*And that by their policie and patience, they had conquered all that place (though it were very farre from them) and the kings also that came against them from the vttermost part of the earth, till they had discomfited them, & giuen them a great ouerthrow, so that the rest did giue them tribute euery yere.
\v 5 \f + \fr 8:5 \ft Or, Macedonians.\f*Besides this, how they had discomfited in battell Philip, and Perseus king of the Citims, with others that lift vp themselues against them, and had ouercome them.
\v 6 How also Antiochus the great king of Asia that came against them in battaile, hauing an hundred and twentie Elephants with horsemen and chariots, and a very great armie, was discomfited by them.
\v 7 And how they tooke him aliue, and couenanted that hee and such as reigned after him, should pay a great tribute, and giue hostages, and that which was agreed vpon,
\v 8 And the country of India, and Media, and Lidia, and of the goodliest countries: which they tooke of him, and gaue to king Eumenes.
\v 9 Moreouer how the Grecians had determined to come and destroy them.
\v 10 And that they hauing knowledge thereof sent against them a certaine captaine, and fighting with them slew many of them, and caried away captiues, their wiues, and their children, and spoiled them, and tooke possession of their lands, and pulled downe their strong holds, and brought them to be their seruants vnto this day.
\v 11 [It was told him besides] how they destroyed and brought vnder their dominion, all other kingdomes and isles that at any time resisted them.
\v 12 But with their friends, and such as relied vpon them they kept amitie: and that they had conquered kingdomes both farre and nigh, insomuch as all that heard of their name were afraid of them.
\v 13 Also that whom they would helpe to a kingdome, those raigne, and whom againe they would, they displace: finally that they were greatly exalted.
\v 14 Yet for all this, none of them wore a crowne, or was clothed in purple to be magnified thereby.
\v 15 Moreouer how they had made for themselues a senate house, wherin three hundred and twentie men sate in counsell daily, consulting alway for the people, to the end they might be wel ordered
\v 16 And that they committed their gouernment to one man euery yeere, who ruled ouer all their countrie, and that all were obedient to that one, and that there was neither enuy, nor emulation amongst them.
\v 17 In consideration of these things Iudas chose Eupolemus the sonne of Iohn, the sonne of Accas, and Iason the sonne of Eleazar, and sent them to Rome to make a league of amitie and confederacie with them,
\v 18 [And to intreate them] that they would take the yoke from them, for they saw that the kingdome of the Grecians did oppresse Israel with seruitude
\v 19 They went therefore to Rome (which was a very great iourney) and came into the Senate, where they spake and said,
\v 20 Iudas Maccabeus with his brethren, and the people of the Iewes, haue sent vs vnto you, to make a confederacie, and peace with you, and that we might be registred, your confederats and friends.
\v 21 So that matter pleased the Romanes well.
\v 22 And this is the copie of the Epistle which (the Senate) wrote backe againe, in tables of brasse: and sent to Ierusalem, that there they might haue by them a memorial of peace & confederacy.
\v 23 Good successe be to the Romans and to the people of the Iewes, by Sea, and by land for euer: the sword also and enemie, be farre from them.
\v 24 If there come first any warre vpon the Romans or any of their confederats throughout all their dominion,
\v 25 The people of the Iewes shall helpe them, as the time shall be appointed, with all their heart.
\v 26 Neither shal they giue any thing, vnto them that make war vpon them, or aide them with victuals, weapons, money, or ships, as it hath seemed good vnto the Romans, but they shall keepe their couenant without taking any thing therefore.
\v 27 In the same maner also, if warre come first vpon the nation of the Iewes, the Romans shall helpe them with all their heart, according as the time shall be appointed them.
\v 28 Neither shal victuals be giuen to thē that take part against thē, or weapons, or money, or ships, as it hath seemed good to the Romanes; but they shall keepe their couenants, and that without deceit.
\v 29 According to these articles did the Romanes make a couenant with the people of the Iewes.
\v 30 Howbeit, if hereafter the one partie or the other, shall thinke meete to adde or diminish any thing, they may doe it at their pleasures, and whatsoeuer they shall adde or take away, shalbe ratified.
\v 31 And as touching the euils that Demetrius doeth to the Iewes, wee haue written vnto him, saying, Wherefore hast thou made thy yoke heauie vpon our friends, and confederats the Iewes?
\v 32 If therefore they complaine any more against thee: wee will doe them iustice, and fight with thee by sea and by land.

\iex 1 Alcimus and Bacchides come againe with new forces into Iudea. 7 The armie of Iudas flee from him, 17 and he is slaine. 30 Ionathan is in his place, 40 and reuengeth his brother Iohns quarrell. 55 Alcimus is plagued, and dieth. 70 Bacchides maketh peace with Ionathan.
\v 1 ¶ \f + \fr 9:1 \ft Gr. he added or proceeded to send.\f*\f + \fr 9:1 \ft Or, the right wing.\f*Furthermore, when Demetrius heard that Nicanor and his hoste were slaine in battell, hee sent Bacchides and Alcimus into the land of Iudea the second time, and with them the chiefe strength of his hoste.
\v 2 \f + \fr 9:2 \ft Or, Galilea.\f*Who went forth by the way that leadeth to Galgala, and pitched their tents before Masaloth, which is in Arbela, and after they had wonne it, they slew much people.
\v 3 Also the first moneth of the hundred fiftie and second yeere, they encamped before Ierusalem.
\v 4 \f + \fr 9:4 \ft Or, Berretho. Ios.\f*From whence they remoued and went to Berea, with twentie thousand footmen, and two thousand horsemen.
\v 5 Now Iudas had pitched his tents at Eleasa, and three thousand chosen men with him.
\v 6 Who seeing the multitude of the other army to be so great, were sore afraide, whereupon many conueyed themselues out of the hoste, insomuch as there abode of them no moe but eight hundred men.
\v 7 When Iudas therefore saw that his hoste slipt away, and that the battell pressed vpon him, he was sore troubled in mind, and much distressed for that he had no time to gather them together.
\v 8 Neuerthelesse vnto them that remained, he said; Let vs arise and goe vp against our enemies, if peraduenture we may be able to fight with them.
\v 9 \f + \fr 9:9 \ft We follow here the Romane copie.\f*But they dehorted him, saying, Wee shall neuer be able: Let vs now rather saue our liues, and hereafter we will returne with our brethren, and fight against them: for we are but few.
\v 10 \f + \fr 9:10 \ft Gr. let vs not leaue any iust cause behinde vs, why our glory should be spoken against.\f*Then Iudas said, God forbid that I should doe this thing, and flee away from them: If our time be come, let vs die manfully for our brethren, and let vs not staine our honour.
\v 11 \f + \fr 9:11 \ft Or the Iewes.\f*With that the hoste [of Bacchides] remoued out of their tents, and stood ouer against them, their horsemen being diuided into two troupes, and their slingers and archers going before the hoste, and they that marched in the foreward were all mighty men.
\v 12 As for Bacchides, hee was in the right wing, so the hoste drew neere on the two parts, and sounded their trumpets.
\v 13 They also of Iudas side, euen they sounded their trumpets also, so that the earth shooke at the noise of the armies, and the battell continued from morning till night.
\v 14 Now when Iudas perceiued that Bacchides and the strength of his armie were on the right side, he tooke with him all the hardy men,
\v 15 Who discomfited the right wing, and pursued them vnto the mount Azotus.
\v 16 But when they of the left wing, saw that they of the right wing were discomfited, they followed vpon Iudas and those that were with him hard at the heeles from behinde:
\v 17 Whereupon there was a sore battell, insomuch as many were slaine on both parts.
\v 18 Iudas also was killed, and the remnant fled.
\v 19 Then Ionathan and Simon tooke Iudas their brother, and buried him in the sepulchre of his fathers in Modin.
\v 20 Moreouer they bewailed him, and all Israel made great lamentation for him, and mourned many dayes, saying;
\v 21 How is the valiant man fallen, that deliuered Israel?
\v 22 As for the other things concerning Iudas and his warres, and the noble actes which he did, and his greatnesse, they are not written: for they were very many.
\v 23 ¶ Now after the death of Iudas, the wicked began to put foorth their heads in all the coasts of Israel, and there rose vp all such as wrought iniquitie.
\v 24 \f + \fr 9:24 \ft Bacchis and his company.\f*In those dayes also was there a very great famine, by reason whereof the countrey reuolted, and went with them.
\v 25 Then Bacchides chose the wicked men, and made them lordes of the countrey.
\v 26 \f + \fr 9:26 \ft Gr. mocked them.\f*And they made enquirie & search for Iudas friends, and brought them vnto Bacchides, who tooke vengeance of them, and vsed them despitefully.
\v 27 So was there a great affliction in Israel, the like whereof was not since the time that a Prophet was not seene amongst them.
\v 28 For this cause all Iudas friends came together, & said vnto Ionathan,
\v 29 Since thy brother Iudas died, we haue no man like him to goe foorth against our enemies, and Bacchides, and against them of our nation that are aduersaries to vs.
\v 30 Now therefore wee haue chosen thee this day to be our prince, and captaine in his stead, that thou mayest fight our battels.
\v 31 Upon this, Ionathan tooke the gouernance vpon him at that time, and rose vp in stead of his brother Iudas.
\v 32 But when Bacchides gat knowledge thereof, he sought for to slay him.
\v 33 Then Ionathan and Simon his brother, and all that were with him, perceiuing that, fled into the wildernes of Thecoe, and pitched their tents by the water of the poole Asphar.
\v 34 \f + \fr 9:34 \ft Or, Which when Bacchides understood, or the Sabbath day he came neere.\f*Which when Bacchides vnderstood, he came neere to Iordan with all his hoste vpon the Sabbath day.
\v 35 \f + \fr 9:35 \ft Ios. Antiq. lib.13. c.1.\f*\f + \fr 9:35 \ft Gr. that he might leaue with them their cariage or stuffe.\f*Now Ionathan had sent his brother [ Iohn] a captaine of the people, to pray his friendes the Nabbathites that they might leaue with them their cariage, which was much.
\v 36 But the children of Iambri came out of Medaba, and tooke Iohn and all that hee had, and went their way with it.
\v 37 \f + \fr 9:37 \ft Or, Medaba.\f*After this came word to Ionathan and Simon his brother, that the children of Iambri made a great mariage, and were bringing the bride from Nadabatha with a great traine, as being the daughter of one of the great princes of Canaan.
\v 38 Therfore they remembred Iohn their brother, and went vp and hidde themselues vnder the couert of the mountaine.
\v 39 \f + \fr 9:39 \ft Or, timbrels\f*\f + \fr 9:39 \ft Or, musicians.\f*Where they lift vp their eyes, and looked, & behold, there was much adoe and great cariage: and the bridegrome came foorth, and his friends & brethren to meet them with drums and instruments of musicke, and many weapons.
\v 40 Then Ionathan and they that were with him, rose vp against them from the place where they lay in ambush, and made a slaughter of them in such sort, as many fell downe dead, and the remnant fledde into the mountaine, and they tooke all their spoiles.
\v 41 Thus was the mariage turned into mourning, and the noise of their melody into lamentation.
\v 42 So when they had auenged fully the blood of their brother, they turned againe to the marish of Iordan.
\v 43 Now when Bacchides heard hereof, hee came on the Sabbath day vnto the banks of Iordan with a great power.
\v 44 Then Ionathan sayde to his company, Let vs goe vp now and fight for our liues, for it standeth not with vs to day, as in time past:
\v 45 For behold, the battell is before vs and behinde vs, and the water of Iordan on this side and that side, the marish likewise and wood, neither is there place for vs to turne aside.
\v 46 Wherefore cry ye now vnto heauen, that ye may be deliuered from the hand of your enemies.
\v 47 With that they ioyned battel, and Ionathan stretched foorth his hand to smite Bacchides, but hee turned backe from him.
\v 48 Then Ionathan and they that were with him, leapt into Iordan, and swamme ouer vnto the farther banke: howbeit the other passed not ouer Iordan vnto them.
\v 49 \f + \fr 9:49 \ft Two thousand men. Ioseph.ant. lib. 13. cap. 1\f*So there were slaine of Bacchides side that day about a thousand men
\v 50 \f + \fr 9:50 \ft Or, built.\f*\f + \fr 9:50 \ft Ioseph.Techoa.\f*Afterward returned [Bacchides] to Ierusalem, and repaired the strong cities in Iudea: the fort in Iericho, and Emmaus, and Bethoron, and Bethel, and Thamnatha, Pharathoni, and Taphon (these did he strengthen with high wals, with gates, & with barres.)
\v 51 And in them he set a garison, that they might worke malice vpon Israel.
\v 52 \f + \fr 9:52 \ft Gr. the citie in Bethsura.\f*He fortified also the citie Bethsura, and Gazara, and the towre, and put forces in them, and prouision of victuals.
\v 53 Besides, he tooke the chiefe mens sonnes in the country for hostages, and put them into the towre at Ierusalem to be kept.
\v 54 Moreouer, in the hundred, fiftie and third yere, in the second moneth, Alcimus commanded that the wall of the inner court of the Sanctuarie should be pulled downe, he pulled downe also the works of the prophets.
\v 55 And as he began to pull downe, euen at that time was Alcimus plagued, and his enterprises hindered: for his mouth was stopped, and he was taken with a palsie, so that hee could no more speake any thing, nor giue order concerning his house.
\v 56 So Alcimus died at that time with great torment.
\v 57 Now when Bacchides saw that Alcimus was dead, he returned to the king, wherupon the land of Iudea was in rest two yeere.
\v 58 Then all the vngodly men held a counsell, saying, Behold, Ionathan and his companie are at ease, and dwell without care: now therefore wee will bring Bacchides hither, who shall take them all in one night.
\v 59 So they went, and consulted with him.
\v 60 Then remoued he, and came with a great hoste, and sent letters priuily to his adherents in Iudea, that they should take Ionathan, and those that were with him: Howbeit they could not, because their counsell was knowen vnto them.
\v 61 Wherefore they tooke of the men of the countrey that were authours of that mischiefe, about fiftie persons, and slew them.
\v 62 Afterward Ionathan and Simon, and they that were with him, got them away to Bethbasi, which is in the wildernesse, and they repaired the decayes thereof, and made it strong.
\v 63 \f + \fr 9:63 \ft Or, to such of the countrey as were his friends to take his part.\f*Which thing when Bacchides knew, he gathered together all his host, and sent word to them that were of Iudea.
\v 64 Then went he and laid siege against Bethbasi, & they fought against it a long season, and made engines of warre.
\v 65 But Ionathan left his brother Simon in the citie, and went forth himselfe into the countrey, and with a certaine number went he forth.
\v 66 \f + \fr 9:66 \ft Or, Odomarra.\f*And he smote Odonarkes and his brethren, and the children of Phasiron in their tent.
\v 67 And when he began to smite them, and came vp with his forces, Simon and his company went out of the citie, and burnt vp the engines of warre,
\v 68 And fought against Bacchides, who was discomfited by them, and they afflicted him sore. For his counsell and trauaile was in vaine.
\v 69 Wherefore he was very wroth at the wicked men that gaue him counsell to come into the countrey, insomuch as he slew many of them, and purposed to returne into his owne countrey.
\v 70 Whereof when Ionathan had knowledge, he sent ambassadours vnto him, to the end he should make peace with him, & deliuer them the prisoners.
\v 71 Which thing hee accepted, and did according to his demaunds, and sware vnto him that hee would neuer doe him harme all the dayes of his life.
\v 72 \f + \fr 9:72 \ft Gr. added he to come any more.\f*When therefore hee had restored vnto him the prisoners that he had taken aforetime out of the land of Iudea, he returned and went his way into his owne land, neither came he any more into their borders.
\v 73 \f + \fr 9:73 \ft Gr. iudge\f*Thus the sword ceased from Israel: but Ionathan dwelt at Machmas, and began to gouerne the people, and he destroyed the vngodly men out of Israel.

\iex 1 Demetrius maketh large offers to haue peace with Ionathan. 25 His letters to the Iewes. 47 Ionathan maketh peace with Alexander, 50 Who killeth Demetrius, 58 and marieth the daughter of Ptolomeus. 62 Ionathan is sent for by him, and much honoured, 75 and preuaileth against the forces of Demetrius the yonger, 84 & burneth the temple of Dagon.
\v 1 ¶ \f + \fr 10:1 \ft Ios. the sonne of Antiochus Epiphanes.\f*In the hundreth & sixtieth yere, Alexander the sonne of Antiochus surnamed Epiphanes, went vp and tooke Ptolemais: for the people had receiued him, by meanes whereof he reigned there.
\v 2 Now when king Demetrius heard thereof, he gathered together an exceeding great host, and went foorth against him to fight.
\v 3 Moreouer Demetrius sent letters vnto Ionathan with louing wordes, so as he magnified him.
\v 4 For, said hee, Let vs first make peace with him before he ioyne with Alexander against vs.
\v 5 Else he wil remember all the euils that we haue done against him, and against his brethren and his people.
\v 6 Wherefore he gaue him authority to gather together an host, and to prouide weapons that hee might aide him in battell: he commaunded also that the hostages that were in the towre, should be deliuered him.
\v 7 Then came Ionathan to Ierusalem, and read the letters in the audience of all the people, and of them that were in the towre.
\v 8 Who were sore afraid when they heard that the king had giuen him authoritie to gather together an host.
\v 9 Whereupon they of the towre deliuered their hostages vnto Ionathan, & he deliuered them vnto their parents.
\v 10 This done, Ionathan setled himselfe in Ierusalem, and began to build and repaire the citie.
\v 11 And he commaunded the workemen to build the wals, and the mount Sion round about with square stones, for fortification, and they did so.
\v 12 Then the strangers that were in the fortresses which Bacchides had built, fled away:
\v 13 Insomuch as euery man left his place, and went into his owne country.
\v 14 Onely at Bethsura certaine of those that had forsaken the law, and the commaundements remained still: for it was their place of refuge.
\v 15 Now when king Alexander had heard what promises Demetrius had sent vnto Ionathan: when also it was told him of the battels and noble acts which he & his brethren had done, and of the paines that they had indured,
\v 16 He said, Shal we find such another man? Now therefore we will make him our friend, and confederate.
\v 17 Upon this he wrote a letter and sent it vnto him according to these words, saying:
\v 18 King Alexander to his brother Ionathan, sendeth greeting:
\v 19 We haue heard of thee, that thou art a man of great power, and meete to be our friend.
\v 20 Wherefore now this day we ordaine thee to bee the high priest of thy nation, and to be called the kings friend, (and there withall he sent him a purple robe and a crowne of gold) to take our part, and keepe friendship with vs.
\v 21 So in the seuenth moneth of the hundreth and sixtieth yere, at the feast of the Tabernacles, Ionathan put on the holy robe, and gathered together forces, and prouided much armour.
\v 22 Wherof when Demetrius heard, he was very sory, and said,
\v 23 What haue we done that Alexander hath preuented vs, in making amity with the Iewes to strengthen himself?
\v 24 I also will write vnto them words of encouragement [and promise them] dignities and gifts, that I may haue their ayde.
\v 25 He sent vnto him therefore, to this effect: King Demetrius vnto the people of the Iewes, sendeth greeting:
\v 26 Whereas you haue kept couenants with vs, & continued in our friendship, not ioyning your selues with our enemies, we haue heard hereof, & are glad:
\v 27 Wherefore now continue yee still to be faithful vnto vs, and we will well recompence you for the things you doe in our behalfe,
\v 28 And will grant you many immunities, and giue you rewards.
\v 29 And now I doe free you, and for your sake I release all the Iewes from tributes, and from the customes of salt, and from crowne taxes,
\v 30 And frō that which appertaineth vnto me to receiue for the third part of the seed, and the halfe of the fruit of the trees, I release it from this day forth, so that they shall not be taken of the land of Iudea, nor of the three gouernments which are added thereunto out of the country of Samaria and Galile, from this day forth for euermore.
\v 31 Let Ierusalem also bee holy and free, with the borders thereof, both from tenths and tributes.
\v 32 And as for the towre which is at Ierusalem, I yeeld vp my authoritie ouer it, and giue it to the high Priest, that he may set in it such men as he shall choose to keepe it.
\v 33 Moreouer I freely set at libertie euery one of the Iewes that were carried captiues out of the land of Iudea, into any part of my kingdome, and I will that all my officers remit the tributes, euen of their cattell.
\v 34 Furthermore, I will that all the Feasts and Sabbaths, & New moones and solemne dayes, and the three dayes before the Feast, and the three dayes after the Feast, shall be all dayes of immunitie and freedom for all the Iewes in my realme.
\v 35 Also no man shall haue authoritie to meddle with them, or to molest any of them in any matter.
\v 36 [I will further] that there be enrolled amongst the kings forces about thirtie thousand men of the Iewes, vnto whom pay shall be giuen as belongeth to all the kings forces.
\v 37 \f + \fr 10:37 \ft Gr. walke.\f*And of them some shalbe placed in the kings strong holds, of whom also some shall be set ouer the affaires of the kingdome, which are of trust: and I will that their ouerseers and gouernours be of themselues, and that they liue after their owne lawes, euen as the King hath commanded in the land of Iudea.
\v 38 And concerning the three gouernments that are added to Iudea from the countrey of Samaria, let them be ioyned with Iudea, that they may be reckoned to be vnder one, nor bound to obey other authoritie then y\sup e\sup* high priests
\v 39 \f + \fr 10:39 \ft Or, of the holy things.\f*As for Ptolemais and the land pertaining thereto, I giue it as a free gift to the Sanctuary at Ierusalem, for the necessary expences of the Sanctuary.
\v 40 Moreouer, I giue euery yeere fifteene thousand shekels of siluer, out of the Kings accompts from the places appertaining.
\v 41 And all the ouerplus which the officers payed not in as in former time, from henceforth shalbe giuen towards the workes of the Temple.
\v 42 And besides this, the fiue thousand shekels of siluer, which they tooke from the vses of the Temple out of the accompts yeere by yeere, euen those things shall be released, because they appertaine to the Priests that minister.
\v 43 And whosoeuer they be that flee vnto the Temple at Ierusalem, or be within the liberties thereof, being indebted vnto the King, or for any other matter, let them be at libertie, and all that they haue in my realme.
\v 44 For the building also and repairing of the workes of the Sanctuary, expences shalbe giuen of the Kings accompts.
\v 45 Yea, and for the building of the walles of Ierusalem, and the fortifying thereof round about, expences shall bee giuen out of the Kings accompts, as also for building of the walles in Iudea.
\v 46 Now when Ionathan and the people heard these words, they gaue no credite vnto them, nor receiued them, because they remembred the great euill that he had done in Israel; for hee had afflicted them very sore.
\v 47 \f + \fr 10:47 \ft True.\f*But with Alexander they were well pleased, because hee was the first that entreated of peace with them, and they were confederate with him alwayes.
\v 48 Then gathered king Alexander great forces, and camped ouer against Demetrius.
\v 49 And after the two Kings had ioyned battell, Demetrius hoste fled: but Alexander followed after him, and preuailed against them.
\v 50 And he continued the battell very sore vntill the Sunne went downe, and that day was Demetrius slaine.
\v 51 Afterward Alexander sent Embassadors to Ptoleme king of Egypt, with a message to this effect;
\v 52 Forsomuch as I am come againe to my realme, and am set in the throne of my progenitors, and haue gotten the dominion, and ouerthrowen Demetrius, and recouered our countrey,
\v 53 (For after I had ioyned battell with him, both he, and his hoste was discomfited by vs, so that we sit in the throne of his kingdome)
\v 54 Now therefore let vs make a league of amitie together, and giue me now thy daughter to wife: & I will be thy son in law, and will giue both thee and her, gifts according to thy dignity.
\v 55 Then Ptoleme the king gaue answere, saying, Happy be the day wherein thou diddest returne into the land of thy fathers, and satest in the throne of their kingdome.
\v 56 And now will I doe to thee, as thou hast written: meet me therefore at Ptolemais, that wee may see one another, for I will marry my daughter to thee according to thy desire.
\v 57 So Ptolome went out of Egypt with his daughter Cleopatra, and they came vnto Ptolemais in the hundred threescore and second yeere.
\v 58 Where king Alexander meeting him, gaue vnto him his daughter Cleopatra, and celebrated her marriage at Ptolemais with great glory, as the maner of kings is.
\v 59 Now king Alexander had written vnto Ionathan, that hee should come and meete him.
\v 60 Who thereupon went honourably to Ptolemais, where he met the two kings, and gaue them and their friends siluer and golde, and many presents, and found fauour in their sight.
\v 61 At that time certaine pestilent fellowes of Israel, men of a wicked life, assembled themselues against him, to accuse him: but the king would not heare them.
\v 62 Yea more then that, the king commanded to take off his garments, and clothe him in purple: and they did so.
\v 63 Also he made him sit by himselfe, and said vnto his princes, Goe with him into the midst of the city, and make proclamation, that no man complaine against him of any matter, and that no man troble him for any maner of cause.
\v 64 Now when his accusers sawe that he was honoured according to the proclamation, and clothed in purple, they fled all away.
\v 65 \f + \fr 10:65 \ft Or, gouernor of a prouince.\f*So the king honoured him, and wrote him amongst his chiefe friends, and made him a duke, and partaker of his dominion.
\v 66 Afterward Ionathan returned to Ierusalem with peace and gladnes.
\v 67 Furthermore, in the hundreth threescore and fifth yeere, came Demetrius sonne of Demetrius, out of Crete into the land of his fathers.
\v 68 Whereof when king Alexander heard tell, he was right sory, and returned into Antioch.
\v 69 Then Demetrius made Apollonius the gouernour of Coelosyria his general, who gathered together a great hoste, and camped in Iamnia and sent vnto Ionathan the high Priest, saying,
\v 70 Thou alone liftest vp thy selfe against vs, and I am laughed to scorne for thy sake, and reproched, and why doest thou vaunt thy power against vs in the mountaines?
\v 71 Now therefore if thou trustest in thine owne strength, come downe to vs into the plaine field, and there let vs trie the matter together, for with me is the power of the cities.
\v 72 Aske and learne who I am, and the rest that take our part, and they shal tel thee that thy foot is not able to stand before our face; for thy fathers haue bene twice put to flight in their owne land.
\v 73 Wherefore now thou shalt not be able to abide the horsemen and so great a power in the plaine, where is neither stone nor flint, nor place to flee vnto.
\v 74 So when Ionathan heard these words of Apollonius, he was moued in his mind, & choosing ten thousand men, he went out of Ierusalē, where Simon his brother met him for to helpe him.
\v 75 And hee pitched his tents against Ioppe: but they of Ioppe shut him out of the citie, because Apollonius had a garison there.
\v 76 Then Ionathan laid siege vnto it: whereupon they of the city let him in for feare: & so Ionathan wan Ioppe.
\v 77 \f + \fr 10:77 \ft Or, as thogh he would passe thorow it.\f*\f + \fr 10:77 \ft Or, led his company.\f*Whereof when Apollonius heard, he tooke three thousand horsemen with a great hoste of footmen, and went to Azotus as one that iourneyed, & therewithal drew him forth into the plaine, because he had a great number of horsemen, in whom he put his trust.
\v 78 Then Ionathan followed after him to Azotus, where the armies ioyned battell.
\v 79 Now Apollonius had left a thousand horsemen in ambush.
\v 80 And Ionathan knew that there was an ambushment behinde him; for they had compassed in his host, and cast darts at the people, from morning till euening.
\v 81 \f + \fr 10:81 \ft Ios. Antiq. lib.13.c.8.\f*But the people stood still, as Ionathan had commanded them: and so the enemies horses were tired.
\v 82 Then brought Simon forth his hoste, and set them against the footmen, (for the horsmen were spent) who were discomfited by him, and fled.
\v 83 The horsemen also being scattered in the field, fled to Azotus, and went into Bethdagō their idols temple for safety.
\v 84 But Ionathan set fire on Azotus, and the cities round about it, and tooke their spoiles, and the temple of Dagon, with them that were fled into it, he burnt with fire.
\v 85 Thus there were burnt and slaine with the sword, well nigh eight thousand men.
\v 86 And from thence Ionathan remoued his hoste, and camped against Ascalon, where the men of the city came forth, and met him with great pompe.
\v 87 After this, returned Ionathan and his hoste vnto Ierusalem, hauing many spoiles.
\v 88 Now when king Alexander heard these things, he honoured Ionathan yet more,
\v 89 And sent him a buckle of golde, as the vse is to be giuen to such as are of the kings blood: he gaue him also Accaron with the borders thereof in possession.
\c 11
\iex 12 Ptolomeus taketh away his daughter from Alexander, and entreth vpon his kingdome. 17 Alexander is slaine, and Ptolemeus dieth within three dayes. 20 Ionathan besiegeth the towre at Ierusalem. 26 The Iewes and he are much honoured by Demetrius, 48 Who is rescued by the Iewes from his owne subiects in Antioch. 57 Antiochus the yonger honoureth Ionathan. 61 His exploits in diuers places
\v 1 ¶ And the king of Egypt gathered together a great host like the sand that lieth vpon the Sea shore, and many ships, and went about through deceit to get Alexanders kingdome, and ioyne it to his owne.
\v 2 Whereupon he tooke his iourney into Syria in peaceable maner, so as they of the cities opened vnto him, and met him: for king Alexander had commanded them so to doe, because he was his father in law.
\v 3 Now as Ptolomee entred into the cities, he set in euery one of them a garison of souldiers to kepe it.
\v 4 And when he came neere to Azotus, they shewed him the temple of Dagon that was burnt, and Azotus, and the suburbs thereof that were destroyed, and the bodies that were cast abroad, and them that he had burnt in the battell, for they had made heapes of them by the way where he should passe.
\v 5 Also they told the king whatsoeuer Ionathan had done, to the intent he might blame him: but the king helde his peace.
\v 6 \f + \fr 11:6 \ft Gr. slept.\f*Then Ionathan met the king with great pompe at Ioppa, where they saluted one another, and lodged.
\v 7 Afterward Ionathan when he had gone with the king to the riuer called Eleutherus, returned againe to Ierusalem.
\v 8 King Ptolomee therefore hauing gotten the dominion of the cities by the sea, vnto Seleucia vpon the sea coast, imagined wicked counsels against Alexander.
\v 9 Whereupon he sent embassadours vnto king Demetrius, saying, Come, let vs make a league betwixt vs, and I will giue thee my daughter whome Alexander hath, and thou shalt reigne in thy fathers kingdome:
\v 10 For I repent y\sup t\sup* I gaue my daughter vnto him, for he sought to slay me.
\v 11 Thus did he slander him, because he was desirous of his kingdome.
\v 12 Wherefore he tooke his daughter from him, and gaue her to Demetrius, and forsooke Alexander, so that their hatred was openly knowen.
\v 13 Then Ptolomee entred into Antioch, where he set two crownes vpō his head, the crowne of Asia, and of Egypt.
\v 14 In the meane season was king Alexander in Cilicia, because those y\sup t\sup* dwelt in those parts, had reuolted from him.
\v 15 But when Alexander heard of this, hee came to warre against him, whereupon king Ptolomee brought forth his hoste, and met him with a mightie power, and put him to flight.
\v 16 So Alexander fled into Arabia, there to be defended, but king Ptolomee was exalted.
\v 17 For Zabdiel the Arabian tooke off Alexanders head, and sent it vnto Ptolomee.
\v 18 \f + \fr 11:18 \ft Gr. and those that were in the holds were slaine of those that were in the holds.\f*King Ptolemee also died the third day after, & they that were in the strong holds, were slaine one of another.
\v 19 By this meanes Demetrius reigned in the hundreth, threescore and seuenth yeere.
\v 20 At the same time Ionathan gathered together them that were in Iudea, to take the towre that was in Ierusalem, and he made many engines of warre against it.
\v 21 Then certaine vngodly persons who hated their owne people, went vnto the king, and told him that Ionathan besieged the towre.
\v 22 Whereof when he heard, he was angry, and immediately remouing, he can to Ptolemais, and wrote vnto Ionathan, that he should not lay siege to the towre, but come and speake with him at Ptolemais in great haste.
\v 23 Neuerthelesse Ionathan when he heard this, commanded to besiege it [still] and he chose certaine of the Elders of Israel, and the priests, and put himselfe in perill.
\v 24 And tooke siluer and gold, and rayment, and diuers presents besides, and went to Ptolemais, vnto the king, where he found fauour in his sight.
\v 25 And though certaine vngodly men of the people, had made complaints against him,
\v 26 Yet the king entreated him as his predecessors had done before, & promoted him in the sight of all his friends,
\v 27 And confirmed him in the high priesthood, and in all the honours that hee had before, and gaue him preeminence among his chiefe friends.
\v 28 Then Ionathan desired the king, that hee would make Iudea free from tribute, as also the three gouernments with the countrey of Samaria, & he promised him three hundred talents
\v 29 So the king consented and wrote letters vnto Ionathan, of all these things after this maner.
\v 30 King Demetrius vnto his brother Ionathan, and vnto the nation of the Iewes, sendeth greeting.
\v 31 We send you heere a copie of the letter, which we did write vnto our cousin Lasthenes, concerning you, that you might see it.
\v 32 King Demetrius vnto his father Lasthenes, sendeth greeting:
\v 33 We are determined to doe good to the people of the Iewes, who are our friends, and keepe couenants with vs, because of their good will towards vs.
\v 34 \f + \fr 11:34 \ft Iosep. antiq.lib. 13. cap.8.\f*Wherefore we haue ratified vnto them the borders of Iudea, with the three gouernments of Apherema, and Lidda, and Ramathem, that are added vnto Iudea, from the countrie of Samaria, and all things appertaining vnto them, for all such, as doe sacrifice in Ierusalem, in stead of the paiments, which the king receiued of them yeerely aforetime out of the fruits of the earth, and of trees.
\v 35 And as for other things that belong vnto vs of the tithes and customes pertaining vnto vs, as also the salt pits, and the crowne taxes, which are due vnto vs, we discharge them of them all for their reliefe.
\v 36 And nothing heereof shall be reuoked from this time foorth for euer.
\v 37 Now therefore see that thou make a copie of these things, and let it be deliuered vnto Ionathan, and set vpon the holy mount in a conspicuous place.
\v 38 After this, when king Demetrius saw that the land was quiet before him, and that no resistance was made against him, he sent away all his forces euery one to his owne place, except certaine bands of strangers, whom he had gathered from the iles of the heathen, wherefore all the forces of his fathers hated him.
\v 39 Moreouer there was one Tryphon, that had beene of Alexanders part afore, who seeing that all the hoste murmured against Demetrius, went to Simalcue the Arabian, that brought vp Antiochus y\sup e\sup* yong sonne of Alexander,
\v 40 And lay sore vpon him, to deliuer him [this young Antiochus] that he might raigne in his fathers stead: he told him therefore all that Demetrius had done, and how his men of warre were at enmitie with him, and there he remained a long season.
\v 41 In the meane time Ionathan sent vnto king Demetrius, that hee would cast those of the towre out of Ierusalem, and those also in the fortresses. For they fought against Israel.
\v 42 So Demetrius sent vnto Ionathan, saying, I will not onely doe this for thee, and thy people, but I will greatly honour thee and thy nation, if opportunitie serue.
\v 43 Now therefore thou shalt do wel if thou send me men to helpe me; for all my forces are gone from me.
\v 44 Upon this Ionathan sent him three thousand strong men vnto Antioch, and when they came to y\sup e\sup* king, the king was very glad of their comming.
\v 45 Howbeit, they that were of the citie, gathered themselues together into the midst of the citie, to the number of an hundreth and twentie thousand men, and would haue slaine the king.
\v 46 Wherefore the king fled into the court, but they of the citie kept the passages of the citie, and began to fight.
\v 47 Then the king called to the Iewes for helpe, who came vnto him all at once, and dispersing themselues through the city, slew that day in the citie to the number of an hundred thousand.
\v 48 Also they set fire on the citie, and gat many spoiles that day, and deliuered the king.
\v 49 So when they of the city saw, that the Iewes had got the city as they would, their courage was abated, wherefore they made supplication to the king, and cried, saying:
\v 50 \f + \fr 11:50 \ft Or, bee friends with vs.\f*Graunt vs peace, and let the Iewes cease from assaulting vs and the citie.
\v 51 With that they cast away their weapons, and made peace, and the Iewes were honoured in the sight of the king, and in the sight of all that were in his realme, and they returned to Ierusalem hauing great spoiles.
\v 52 So king Demetrius sate on the throne of his kingdome, and the land was quiet before him.
\v 53 Neuerthelesse hee dissembled in all that euer hee spake, and estranged himselfe from Ionathan, neither rewarded he him, according to the benefits which hee had receiued of him, but troubled him very sore.
\v 54 After this returned Tryphon, and with him the yong childe Antiochus, who reigned and was crowned.
\v 55 Then there gathered vnto him all the men of warre whom Demetrius had put away, and they fought against Demetrius, who turned his backe and fled.
\v 56 \f + \fr 11:56 \ft Gr. beasts.\f*Moreouer Triphon tooke the Elephants, and wonne Antioch.
\v 57 At that time yong Antiochus wrote vnto Ionathan, saying; I confirme thee in the high Priesthood, and appoint thee ruler ouer the foure gouernments, and to be one of the kings friends.
\v 58 \f + \fr 11:58 \ft Gr. and seruice.\f*Upon this he sent him golden vessels to be serued in, and gaue him leaue to drinke in gold, and to bee clothed in purple, and to weare a golden buckle.
\v 59 His brother Simon also he made captaine from the place called the ladder of Tyrus, vnto the borders of Egypt.
\v 60 \f + \fr 11:60 \ft Or, went beyond the riuer, and passed through the cities: Or, went and passed beyond the riuer, and through the cities, Gr.\f*Then Ionathan went foorth and passed through the cities beyond the water, and all the forces of Syria, gathered themselues vnto him for to helpe him: and when he came to Ascalon, they of the city met him honorably.
\v 61 \f + \fr 11:61 \ft Or, the places thereabout.\f*From whence he went to Gaza, but they of Gaza shut him out; wherefore hee layd siege vnto it, and burned the suburbs thereof with fire, and spoiled them.
\v 62 \f + \fr 11:62 \ft Gr. he gaue them the right hand.\f*Afterward when they of Gaza made supplication vnto Ionathan, he made peace with them, and tooke the sonnes of the chiefe men for hostages, and sent them to Ierusalem, and passed through the countrey vnto Damascus.
\v 63 \f + \fr 11:63 \ft Or, to remooue him from the affaires of the kingdome.\f*Now when Ionathan heard that Demetrius Princes were come to Cades which is in Galilee, with a great power, purposing to remoue him out of the countrey,
\v 64 Hee went to meet them, and left Simon his brother in the countrey.
\v 65 Then Simon encamped against Bethsura, and fought against it a long season, and shut it vp:
\v 66 But they desired to haue peace with him, which he granted them, and then put them out from thence, and tooke the city, and set a garrison in it.
\v 67 As for Ionathan and his hoste, they pitched at the water of Gennesar, from whence betimes in the morning they gate them to the plaine of Nasor.
\v 68 And behold, the hoste of strangers met them in the plaine, who hauing layed men in ambush for him in the mountaines, came themselues ouer against him.
\v 69 So when they that lay in ambush rose out of their places, and ioyned battel, al that were of Ionathans side fled.
\v 70 In so much as there was not one of them left, except Mattathias the sonne of Absolon, and Iudas the sonne of Calphi the captaines of the hoste.
\v 71 Then Ionathan rent his clothes, and cast earth vpon his head, and prayed.
\v 72 Afterwards turning againe to battell, he put them to flight, and so they ranne away.
\v 73 Now when his owne men that were fled saw this, they turned againe vnto him, and with him pursued them to Cades, euen vnto their owne tents, and there they camped.
\v 74 So there were slaine of the heathen that day, about three thousand men, but Ionathan returned to Ierusalem.

\iex 1 Ionathan reneweth his league with the Romanes and Lacedemonians. 28 The forces of Demetrius thinking to surprise Ionathan, flee away for feare. 35 Ionathan fortifieth the castles in Iudea, 48 and is shut vp by the fraud of Tryphon in Ptolemais.
\v 1 ¶ Nowe when Ionathan saw that the time serued him, he chose certaine men and sent them to Rome, for to confirme and renew the friendship that they had with them.
\v 2 He sent letters also to the Lacedemonians, and to other places, for the same purpose.
\v 3 So they went vnto Rome, and entred into the Senate, and said, Ionathan the high Priest, and the people of the Iewes sent vs vnto you, to the end you should renew the friendship which you had with them, and league, as in former time.
\v 4 Upon this the Romanes gaue them letters vnto the gouernours of euery place, that they should bring them into the land of Iudea peaceably.
\v 5 And this is the copy of the letters which Ionathan wrote to the Lacedemonians:
\v 6 Ionathan the hie Priest, and the Elders of the nation, and the Priestes and the other people of the Iewes, vnto the Lacedemonians their brethren, send greeting.
\v 7 \f + \fr 12:7 \ft Anew: booke Ioseph. Ant.lib.13. cap.8.\f*There were letters sent in times past vnto Onias the high Priest from Darius, who reigned then among you, to signifie that you are our brethren, as the copy here vnder-written doeth specifie.
\v 8 \f + \fr 12:8 \ft Or, kinred, Ios. Aur.\f*At which time Onias intreated the Embassador that was sent, honourably, and receiued the letters, wherein declaration was made of the league and friendship.
\v 9 Therefore we also, albeit we need none of these things, for that wee haue the holy bookes of Scripture in our hands to comfort vs,
\v 10 Haue neuerthelesse attempted to send vnto you, for the renewing of brotherhood and friendship, lest we should become strangers vnto you altogether: for there is a long time passed since you sent vnto vs.
\v 11 We therefore at all times without ceasing, both in our Feasts, and other conuenient dayes, doe remember you in the sacrifices which we offer, and in our prayers, as reason is, and as it becommeth vs to thinke vpon our brethren:
\v 12 And wee are right glad of your honour.
\v 13 As for our selues, wee haue had great troubles and warres on euery side, forsomuch as the kings that are round about vs haue fought against vs.
\v 14 Howbeit wee would not be troublesome vnto you, nor to others of our confederates & friends in these warres:
\v 15 For wee haue helpe from heauen that succoureth vs, so as we are deliuered from our enemies, and our enemies are brought vnder foote.
\v 16 For this cause we chose Numenius the son of Antiochus, and Antipater the sonne of Iason, and sent them vnto the Romanes, to renew the amitie that we had with them, and the former league.
\v 17 We commanded them also to goe vnto you, and to salute you, and to deliuer you our letters, concerning the renewing of our brotherhood.
\v 18 Wherefore now ye shall doe well to giue vs an answere thereto.
\v 19 \f + \fr 12:19 \ft Read out of Ios. which Areus sent to Onias.\f*And this is the copy of the letters which Omiares sent:
\v 20 Areus king of the Lacedemonians, to Onias the hie Priest, greeting.
\v 21 It is found in writing, that the Lacedemonians and Iewes are brethren, and that they are of the stocke of Abraham:
\v 22 \f + \fr 12:22 \ft Gr. peace.\f*Now therefore, since this is come to our knowledge, you shall doe well to write vnto vs of your prosperitie.
\v 23 We doe write backe againe to you, that your cattell and goods are ours, and ours are yours. We doe command therefore [our Embassadours] to make report vnto you on this wise.
\v 24 Now when Ionathan heard that Demetrius princes were come to fight against him with a greater hoste then afore,
\v 25 \f + \fr 12:25 \ft Or, to set foote in his countrey: or, to inuade his countrey.\f*Hee remooued from Ierusalem, and met them in the land of Amathis: for he gaue them no respite to enter his countrey.
\v 26 He sent spies also vnto their tents, who came againe, and tolde him, that they were appointed to come vpon them in the night season.
\v 27 Wherefore so soone as the Sunne was downe, Ionathan commaunded his men to watch, and to be in armes, that all the night long they might bee ready to fight: Also he sent foorth sentinels round about the hoste.
\v 28 \x + \xo 12:28 \xt Ioseph. lib. ant.13.9. they went away.\x*But when the aduersaries heard that Ionathan and his men were ready for battell, they feared, and trembled in their hearts, and they kindled fires in their campe.
\v 29 Howbeit Ionathan and his company knew it not till the morning: for they saw the lights burning.
\v 30 Then Ionathan pursued after them, but ouertooke them not: for they were gone ouer the riuer Eleutherus.
\v 31 \f + \fr 12:31 \ft Ios. gr. Nabatheans, or Zabatheans.\f*Wherefore Ionathan turned to the Arabians, who were called Zabadeans, and smote them, and tooke their spoiles.
\v 32 And remouing thence, he came to Damascus, and so passed through all the countrey.
\v 33 Simon also went foorth, and passed through the countrey vnto Ascalon, and the holds there adioyning, from whence he turned aside to Ioppe, and wanne it.
\v 34 For he had heard that they would deliuer the hold vnto them that tooke Demetrius part, wherefore he set a garison there to keepe it.
\v 35 After this came Ionathan home againe, and calling the Elders of the people together, hee consulted with them about building strong holdes in Iudea,
\v 36 And making the walles of Ierusalem higher, and raising a great mount betweene the towre and the city, for to separate it from the city, that so it might be alone, that men might neither sell nor buy in it.
\v 37 \f + \fr 12:37 \ft Or, according to the Romane reading, and he came neere to the wall of the brooke toward the East.\f*Upon this they came together, to build vp the citie forasmuch as [part of] the wall toward the brooke on the East side was fallen down, & they repaired that which was called Caphenatha
\v 38 Simon also set vp Adida, in Sephela, and made it strong with gates and barres.
\v 39 Now Tryphon went about to get the kingdome of Asia, and to kill Antiochus the king, that hee might set the crowne vpon his owne head.
\v 40 Howbeit, he was afraid that Ionathan would not suffer him, and that he would fight against him, wherefore he sought a way, howe to take Ionathan, that he might kill him. So he remoued, and came to Bethsan.
\v 41 Then Ionathan went out to meet him with fourtie thousand men, chosen for the battell, and came to Bethsan.
\v 42 Now when Tryphon saw that Ionathan came with so great a force, hee durst not stretch his hande against him,
\v 43 But receiued him honourably, and cōmended him vnto all his friends, and gaue him gifts, and commaunded his men of warre to be as obedient vnto him, as to himselfe.
\v 44 Unto Ionathan also hee said, Why hast thou put all this people to so great trouble, seeing there is no warre betwixt vs?
\v 45 Therefore send them now home againe, and chuse a few men to waite on thee, and come thou with me to Ptolemais, for I will giue it thee and the rest of the strong holds and forces, and all that haue any charge: as for me, I will returne and depart: for this is the cause of my comming.
\v 46 So Ionathan beleeuing him, did as he bade him, and sent away his host, who went into the land of Iudea.
\v 47 \f + \fr 12:47 \ft Gr. left two thousand in Galile.\f*And with himselfe hee retained but three thousand men, of whome he sent two thousand into Galile, and one thousand went with him.
\v 48 Now assoone as Ionathan entred into Ptolemais, they of Ptolemais shut the gates, and tooke him, and all them that came with him, they shewe with the sword.
\v 49 Then sent Tryphon an hoste of footmen, and horsemen into Galile, and into the great plaine, to destroy all Ionathans company.
\v 50 But when they knew that Ionathan and they that were with him were taken and slaine, they encouraged one another, and went close together, prepared to fight.
\v 51 They therfore that followed vpon them, perceiuing y\sup t\sup* they were ready to fight for their liues, turned back againe.
\v 52 Whereupon they all came into the land of Iudea peaceably, and there they bewailed Ionathan & them that were with him, & they were sore afraid, wherfore all Israel made great lamentation.
\v 53 Then all the heathen that were round about them, sought to destroy them. For, said they, they haue no captaine, nor any to helpe them. Now therfore let vs make war vpon them, & take away their memorial frō amongst men.
\c 13
\iex 8 Simon is made captaine in his brother Ionathans roume. 19 Tryphon getteth two of Ionathans sonnes into his hands, and slayeth their father. 27 The tombe of Ionathan. 36 Simon is fauoured by Demetrius, 46 and winneth Gaza, and the towre at Hierusalem.
\v 1 ¶ Now when Simon heard that Tryphon had gathered together a great hoste to inuade the land of Iudea, and destroy it,
\v 2 And saw that the people was in great trembling and feare, he went vp to Ierusalem, and gathered the people together,
\v 3 And gaue them exhortation, saying: Yee your selues know, what great things I and my brethren, and my fathers house haue done for the lawes, and the Sanctuarie, the battels also, and troubles which we haue seene,
\v 4 By reason whereof all my brethren are slaine for Israels sake, and I am left alone.
\v 5 Now therefore be it farre from me, that I should spare mine owne life in any time of trouble: for I am no better then my brethren.
\v 6 Doubtlesse I will auenge my nation and the Sanctuarie, & our wiues, and our children: for all the heathen are gathered to destroy vs, of very malice.
\v 7 Now as soone as the people heard these words, their spirit reuiued.
\v 8 And they answered with a loud voice, saying, Thou shalt bee our leader in stead of Iudas and Ionathan thy brother.
\v 9 Fight thou our battels, & what soeuer thou commandest vs, that will we doe.
\v 10 So then he gathered together all the men of warre, and made hast to finish the walles of Ierusalem, and he fortified it round about.
\v 11 Also he sent Ionathan, the sonne of Absolom, & with him a great power to Ioppe, who casting out them that were therein, remained there in it.
\v 12 So Tryphon remoued from Ptolemais, with a great power to inuade the land of Iudea, and Ionathan was with him in warde.
\v 13 But Simon pitched his tents at Adida, ouer against the plaine.
\v 14 Now when Tryphon knew that Simon, was risen vp in stead of his brother Ionathan, and meant to ioyne battell with him, he sent messengers vnto him, saying,
\v 15 \f + \fr 13:15 \ft Or, for the affaires, or officers that he had, for the necessary vses which he had.\f*Whereas we haue Ionathan thy brother in hold, it is for money that he is owing vnto the kings treasure, concerning the businesse that was committed vnto him.
\v 16 Wherefore, now send an hundred talents of siluer, and two of his sonnes for hostages, that when he is at liberty he may not reuolt from vs, and we will let him goe.
\v 17 Heereupon Simon, albeit he perceiued that they spake deceiptfully vnto him, yet sent he the money, and the children, lest peraduenture he should procure to himselfe great hatred of the people:
\v 18 Who might haue said, Because I sent him not the money, and the children, therefore is [Ionathan] dead.
\v 19 So he sent them the children, and the hundred talents: Howbeit [Tryphon] dissembled, neither would he let Ionathan goe.
\v 20 And after this came Tryphon to inuade the land, and destroy it, going round about by the way that leadeth vnto Adora, but Simon and his host marched against him in euery place wheresoeuer he went.
\v 21 Now they that were in the towre, sent messengers vnto Tryphon, to the end that he should hasten his comming vnto them by the wildernesse, and send them victuals.
\v 22 Wherefore Tryphon made readie all his horsemen to come that night, but there fell a very great snow, by reason whereof he came not: So he departed & came into the countrey of Galaad.
\v 23 And when he came neere to Bascama, he slew Ionathan, who was buried there.
\v 24 Afterward Tryphon returned, and went into his owne land.
\v 25 Then sent Simon and tooke the bones of Ionathan his brother, and buried them in Modin the citie of his fathers.
\v 26 And all Israel made great lamentation for him, and bewailed him many daies.
\v 27 Simon also built a monument vpon the Sepulchre of his father and his brethren, and raised it aloft to the sight, with hewen stone behind and before.
\v 28 Moreouer hee set vp seuen pyramides one against another, for his father and his mother, and his foure brethren.
\v 29 And in these he made running deuices, about the which he set great pillars, and vpon the pillars he made all their armour for a perpetuall memory, and by the armour, ships carued, that they might be seene of all that saile on the sea.
\v 30 This is the Sepulchre which he made at Modin, and it standeth yet vnto this day.
\v 31 Now Tryphon dealt deceitfully with the yong king Antiochus, and slew him,
\v 32 And he raigned in his stead, and crowned himselfe king of Asia, and brought a great calamitie vpō the land.
\v 33 \f + \fr 13:33 \ft Gr. in the strong holds.\f*Then Simon built vp the strong holds in Iudea, and fensed them about with high towres, and great walles and gates and barres, and layd vp victuals therein.
\v 34 \f + \fr 13:34 \ft Gr. All Tryphons doings were robberies.\f*Moreouer Simon chose men, and sent to king Demetrius, to the end he should giue the land an immunitie, because all that Tryphon did, was to spoyle.
\v 35 Unto whom king Demetrius answered and wrote after this maner.
\v 36 King Demetrius vnto Simon the high Priest, and friend of kings, as also vnto the Elders and nation of the Iewes, sendeth greeting.
\v 37 The golden crowne, and the scarlet robe which ye sent vnto vs, we haue receiued, and wee are ready to make a stedfast peace with you, yea and to write vnto our officers to confirme the immunities which we haue granted.
\v 38 And whatsoeuer couenants we haue made with you, shall stand, and the strong holdes which yee haue builded shalbe your owne.
\v 39 As for any ouersight or fault committed vnto this day, we forgiue it, and the crowne taxe also which yee owe vs, if there were any other tribute paide in Ierusalem, it shall no more be paide.
\v 40 And looke who are meet among you to be in our court, let them be inrolled, and let there be peace betwixt vs.
\v 41 Thus the yoke of the heathen was taken away from Israel, in the hundred and seuentieth yeere.
\v 42 Then the people of Israel began to write in their instruments, and contracts, in the first yeere of Simon the high Priest, the gouernour, and leader of the Iewes.
\v 43 In those dayes Simon camped against Gaza, and besieged it round about; he made also an engine of warre, and set it by the city, and battered a certaine towre, and tooke it.
\v 44 And they that were in the Engine leapt into the citie, whereupon there was a great vproare in the citie:
\v 45 \f + \fr 13:45 \ft Gr. to giue them his right hand.\f*Insomuch as the people of the citie rent their clothes, and climed vpon the walles, with their wiues and children, and cried with a lowd voice, beseeching Simon to grant them peace.
\v 46 And they said, Deale not with vs according to our wickednesse, but according to thy mercy.
\v 47 So Simon was appeased towards them, and fought no more against them, but put them out of the citie, and cleansed the houses wherein the idols were: and so entred into it, with songs, and thankesgiuing.
\v 48 Yea, he put all vncleannesse out of it, and placed such men there, as would keepe the Law, and made it stronger then it was before, and built therein a dwelling place for himselfe.
\v 49 They also of the towre in Ierusalem were kept so strait, that they could neither come foorth, nor goe into the countrey, nor buy, nor sell, wherefore they were in great distresse for want of victuals, and a great number of them perished through famine.
\v 50 \f + \fr 13:50 \ft Or, to make peace with them.\f*Then cried they to Simon, beseeching him to bee at one with them, which thing hee graunted them, and when he had put them out from thence, he cleansed the towre from pollutions:
\v 51 And entred into it the three and twentieth day of the second moneth, in the hundred seuentie and one yere, with thankesgiuing, and branches of palme trees, and with harpes, and cymbals, and with viols and hymnes, and songs: because there was destroyed a great enemy out of Israel.
\v 52 Hee ordained also that that day should be kept euery yeere with gladnes. Moreouer, the hill of the Temple that was by the towre he made stronger then it was, and there hee dwelt himselfe with his company.
\v 53 And when Simon sawe that Iohn his sonne was a valiant man, he made him captaine of all the hostes and dwelt in Gazara.
\c 14
\iex 3 Demetrius is taken by the King of Persia. 4 The good deedes of Simon to his countrey. 18 The Lacedemonians and Romans renew their league with him. 26 A memoriall of his actes is set vp in Sion.
\v 1 ¶ Now in the hundred threescore and twelfth yeere, king Demetrius gathered his forces together, and went into Media, to get him helpe to fight against Tryphon.
\v 2 But when Arsaces the king of Persia & Media, heard that Demetrius was entred within his borders, he sent one of his princes to take him aliue.
\v 3 Who went and smote the hoste of Demetrius, and tooke him and brought him to Arsaces, by whom hee was put in warde.
\v 4 As for the land of Iudea, that was quiet all the dayes of Simon: for he sought the good of his nation, in such wise, as that euermore his authoritie and honour pleased them well.
\v 5 And as he was honourable (in all his acts) so in this, that he tooke Ioppe for an hauen, and made an entrance to the yles of the Sea,
\v 6 And enlarged the boundes of his nation, and recouered the countrey,
\v 7 And gathered together a great number of captiues, and had the dominion of Gazara and Bethsura, and the towre, out of the which he tooke all vncleannesse, neither was there any that resisted him.
\v 8 Then did they till their ground in peace, and the earth gaue her increase, and the trees of the field their fruit.
\v 9 \f + \fr 14:9 \ft Or, the wealth of the land.\f*The ancient men sate all in the streetes, communing together of good things, and the young men put on glorious and warrelike apparell.
\v 10 He prouided victuals for the cities, and set in them all maner of munition, so that his honourable name was renowmed vnto the end of the world.
\v 11 He made peace in the land, and Israel reioyced with great ioy:
\v 12 \x + \xo 14:12 \xt 1.Kings 4.25.\x*For euery man sate vnder his vine, and his figgetree, and there was none to fray them:
\v 13 Neither was there any left in the lande to fight against them: yea, the Kings themselues were ouerthrowen in those dayes.
\v 14 Moreouer hee strengthened all those of his people that were brought low: the Law he searched out, and euery contemner of the Law, and wicked person, he tooke away.
\v 15 He beautified the Sanctuary, and multiplied the vessels of the Temple.
\v 16 Now when it was heard at Rome, & as far as Sparta, that Ionathan was dead, they were very sorie.
\v 17 But assoone as they heard that his brother Simon was made high Priest in his stead, and ruled the countrey, and the cities therein,
\v 18 They wrote vnto him in tables of brasse, to renew the friendship & league which they had made with Iudas and Ionathan his brethren:
\v 19 Which writings were read before the Congregation at Ierusalem.
\v 20 And this is the copy of the letters that the Lacedemonians sent: The rulers of the Lacedemonians, with the city, vnto Simon the high Priest, and the Elders and Priestes, and residue of the people of the Iewes, our brethren, send greeting.
\v 21 The Embassadors that were sent vnto our people, certified vs of your glory and honour, wherefore we were glad of their comming,
\v 22 And did register the things that they spake, in the counsell of the people, in this maner: Numenius sonne of Antiochus, and Antipater sonne of Iason, the Iewes Embassadours, came vnto vs, to renew the friendship they had with vs.
\v 23 And it pleased the people to entertaine the men honourably, and to put the copy of their embassage in publike records, to the end the people of the Lacedemonians might haue a memoriall therof: furthermore we haue written a copy thereof vnto Simon the hie Priest.
\v 24 After this, Simon sent Numenius to Rome, with a great shield of golde of a thousand pound weight, to confirme the league with them.
\v 25 Whereof when the people heard, they said, What thankes shall wee giue to Simon and his sonnes?
\v 26 For hee and his brethren, and the house of his father, haue established Israel, and chased away in fight their enemies from them, and confirmed their libertie.
\v 27 So then they wrote [it] in tables of brasse, which they set vpon pillars in mount Sion, and this is the copie of the writing. The eighteenth day of the moneth Elul, in the hundred threescore and twelft yeere, being the third yeere of Simon the hie priest,
\v 28 \f + \fr 14:28 \ft Or, Ierusalem, peraduenture by corruption and transposition of letters, or as some thinke, the common hall where they met to consult of matters of estate.\f*At Saramel in the great congregation of the priests and people, and rulers of the nation, & elders of the country, were these things notified vnto vs.
\v 29 Forsomuch as often times there haue bin warres in the countrey, wherin for the maintenance of their Sanctuarie, and the law, Simon the sonne of Mattathias of the posteritie of Iarib, together with his brethren, put themselues in ieopardie, and resisting the enemies of their nation, did their nation great honour.
\v 30 (For after that Ionathan hauing gathered his nation together, and bene their hie priest, was added to his people,
\v 31 Their enemies purposed to inuade their countrey that they might destroy it, and lay hands on the Sanctuary.
\v 32 \f + \fr 14:32 \ft Or, the men of warre.\f*At which time Simon rose vp, and fought for his nation, and spent much of his own substance, & armed the valiant men of his nation, & gaue them wages,
\v 33 \f + \fr 14:33 \ft Or, weapons.\f*And fortified the cities of Iudea, together with Bethsura that lieth vpon the borders of Iudea, where the armour of the enemies had bin before, but he set a garison of Iewes there.
\v 34 \f + \fr 14:34 \ft Or, Gaza.\f*Moreouer, hee fortified Ioppe which lieth vpon the Sea, and Gazara that bordereth vpon Azotus, where the enemies had dwelt before: but hee placed Iewes there, and furnished them with all things conuenient for the reparation thereof.)
\v 35 The people therefore seeing the acts of Simon, and vnto what glory he thought to bring his nation, made him their gouernor and chiefe priest, because he had done all these things, and for the iustice and faith which hee kept to his nation, and for that hee sought by all meanes to exalt his people.
\v 36 \f + \fr 14:36 \ft Or, vnto religion.\f*For in his time things prospered in his hands, so that the heathen were taken out of their countrey, and they also that were in the citie of Dauid in Ierusalem, who had made themselues a towre, out of which they issued, and polluted all about the Sanctuarie, and did much hurt in the holy place.
\v 37 But he placed Iewes therein, and fortified it for the safetie of the countrey, and the city, and raised vp the wals of Ierusalem.
\v 38 King Demetrius also confirmed him in the high priesthood, according to those things,
\v 39 And made him one of his friends, and honoured him with great honour.
\v 40 For he had heard say, that the Romanes had called the Iewes their friends, and confederates, and brethren, and that they had entertained the Embassadours of Simon honourably.
\v 41 Also that the Iewes & priests were wel pleased that Simon should be their gouernour, and high priest for euer vntil there should arise a faithfull prophet.
\v 42 Moreouer, that he should be their captaine, and should take charge of the Sanctuarie, to set them ouer their workes, and ouer the countrey, and ouer the armour, and ouer the fortresses, that (I say) he should take charge of the Sanctuarie.
\v 43 Besides this, that he should be obeyed of euery man, and that all the writings in the countrey should be made in his name, and that he should be clothed in purple, and weare gold.
\v 44 Also that it should be lawfull for none of the people or priests, to breake any of these things, or to gainesay his words, or to gather an assembly in the countrey without him, or to bee clothed in purple, or weare a buckle of gold.
\v 45 And whosoeuer should do otherwise, or breake any of these things, he should be punished.
\v 46 Thus it liked all y\sup e\sup* people to deale with Simon, & to do as hath bene said.
\v 47 Then Simon accepted hereof, and was well pleased to be high Priest, and captaine, and gouernour of the Iewes, & priests, & to defend them all.
\v 48 So they commanded that this writing should be put in tables of brasse, and that they should be set vp within the compasse of the Sanctuary in a conspicuous place.
\v 49 Also y\sup t\sup* the copies therof should be laid vp in the treasurie, to the ende that Simon & his sonnes might haue them.
\c 15
\iex 4 Antiochus desireth leaue to passe through Iudea, & granteth great honours to Simon and the Iewes. 16 The Romanes write to diuerse kings & nations to fauour the Iewes. 27 Antiochus quarrelleth with Simon, 38 and sendeth some to annoy Iudea.
\v 1 ¶ Moreouer Antiochus sonne of Demetrius the king, sent letters from the isles of the Sea, vnto Simon the priest, and prince of the Iewes, and to all the people.
\v 2 The contents whereof were these: King Antiochus, to Simon the high Priest, and prince of his nation, and to the people of the Iewes, greeting,
\v 3 For as much as certaine pestilent men, haue vsurped the kingdome of our fathers, and my purpose is to chalenge it againe, that I may restore it to the old estate, and to that end haue gathered a multitude of forraine souldiers together, and prepared shippes of warre,
\v 4 My meaning also being to goe through the countrey, that I may be auenged of them that haue destroyed it, and made many cities in the kingdome desolate:
\v 5 Now therefore I confirme vnto thee, all the oblations which the kings before me granted thee, and whatsoeuer gifts besides they granted.
\v 6 I giue thee leaue also to coine money for thy countrey with thine owne stampe.
\v 7 And as concerning Ierusalem, and the Sanctuarie, let them be free, and al the armour that thou hast made, and fortresses that thou hast built, and keepest in thy hands, let them remaine vnto thee.
\v 8 And if any thing bee, or shall be owing to the king, let it be forgiuen thee, from this time forth for euermore.
\v 9 Furthermore, when we haue obtained our kingdome, we will honour thee, and thy nation, and thy temple with great honour, so that your honour shall bee knowen throughout the world.
\v 10 In the hundred threescore and fourteenth yeere, went Antiochus into the land of his fathers, at which time all the forces came together vnto him, so that few were left with Tryphon.
\v 11 Wherefore being pursued by king Antiochus, he fled vnto Dora, which lieth by the Seaside.
\v 12 For he saw, that troubles came vpon him all at once, and that his forces had forsaken him.
\v 13 Then camped Antiochus against Dora, hauing with him, an hundred and twentie thousand men of warre, and eight thousand horsemen.
\v 14 And when he had compassed the citie round about, and ioyned ships close to the towne on the Sea side, hee vexed the citie by land, and by Sea, neither suffered he any to goe out or in.
\v 15 In the meane season came Numenius, & his company from Rome hauing letters to the kings and countries, wherein were written these things.
\v 16 Lucius, Consul of the Romanes, vnto king Ptolomee greeting.
\v 17 The Iewes Embassadors our friends and confederates, came vnto vs to renew the old friendship and league, being sent from Simon the high Priest, and from the people of the Iewes.
\v 18 And they brought a shield of gold, of a thousand pound:
\v 19 We thought it good therefore, to write vnto the kings and countries, that they should doe them no harme, nor fight against them, their cities, or countries, nor yet aide their enemies against them.
\v 20 It seemed also good to vs, to receiue the shield of them.
\v 21 If therefore there be any pestilent fellowes, that haue fled from their countrie vnto you, deliuer them vnto Simon the high priest, that hee may punish them according to their owne lawe.
\v 22 \f + \fr 15:22 \ft Or, Arathes.\f*The same thing wrote hee likewise vnto Demetrius the king, and Attalus, to Ariarathes, and Arsaces,
\v 23 \f + \fr 15:23 \ft Or, Sampsaces.\f*\f + \fr 15:23 \ft Or, Basilis.\f*And to all the countries, and to Sampsames, & the Lacedemonians, and to Delus, and Myndus, and Sycion, and Caria, and Samos, and Pamphylia, and Lycia, and Halicarnassus, and Rhodus, and Phaseilis, and Cos, and Sidee, and Aradus, and Gortina, and Cnidus, and Cyprus, and Cyrene.
\v 24 And the copy heereof they wrote, to Simon the high Priest.
\v 25 \f + \fr 15:25 \ft Gre. bringing his forces to it.\f*So Antiochus the king camped against Dora, the second day, assaulting it continually, and making engins, by which meanes he shut vp Tryphon, that he could neither goe out nor in.
\v 26 At that time Simon sent him two thousand chosen men to aide him: siluer also, and gold, and much armour.
\v 27 Neuerthelesse, he would not receiue them, but brake all the couenants which he had made with him afore, and became strange vnto him.
\v 28 Furthermore hee sent vnto him Athenobius, one of his friends to commune with him and say: you withhold Ioppe and Gazara with the towre that is in Ierusalem, which are cities of my realme.
\v 29 The borders thereof yee haue wasted and done great hurt in the land, and got the dominion of many places within my kingdome.
\v 30 \f + \fr 15:30 \ft Or, except the borders, &c.\f*Now therefore deliuer the cities which ye haue taken, and the tributes of the places whereof yee haue gotten dominion without the borders of Iudea.
\v 31 \f + \fr 15:31 \ft Or, subdue you in fight.\f*Or else giue me for them fiue hundred talents of siluer, and for the harme that you haue done, and the tributes of the cities other fiue hundred talents: if not, we wil come and fight against you.
\v 32 So Athenobius the kings friend came to Ierusalem, and when hee saw the glory of Simon, and the cupboard of gold, and siluer plate, and his great attendance, he was astonished and told him the kings message.
\v 33 Then answered Simon, and said vnto him, We haue neither taken other mens land, nor holden that which apperteineth to others, but the inheritance of our fathers, which our enemies had wrongfully in possession a certaine time.
\v 34 Wherefore we hauing opportunitie, hold the inheritance of our fathers.
\v 35 And whereas thou demaundest Ioppe and Gazara; albeit they did great harme vnto the people in our countrey, yet will we giue an hundred talents for them. Hereunto Athenobius answered him not a word,
\v 36 But returned in a rage to the king, and made report vnto him of these speaches, and of the glory of Simon, and of all that hee had seene: whereupon the king was exceeding wroth.
\v 37 In the meane time fled Tryphon by ship vnto Orthosias.
\v 38 Then the king made Cendebeus captaine of the sea coast, and gaue him an hoste of footmen and horsemen,
\v 39 And commanded him to remoue his hoste toward Iudea: also hee commanded him to build vp Cedron, and to fortifie the gates, & to warre against the people, but as for the king [himselfe] he pursued Tryphon.
\v 40 So Cendebeus came to Iamnia, and began to prouoke the people, and to inuade Iudea, and to take the people prisoners, and slay them.
\v 41 And when hee had built vp Cedron, he set horsemen there, and an host [of footmen] to the end that issuing out, they might make outroades vpon the wayes of Iudea, as the king had commanded him.
\c 16
\iex 3 Iudas and Iohn preuaile against the forces sent by Antiochus. 11 The captaine of Hierico inuiteth Simon and two of his sonnes into his castle, and there treacherously murdereth them. 19 Iohn is sought for, 22 and escapeth, and killeth those that sought for him.
\v 1 ¶ Then came vp Iohn from Gazara, and told Simon his father, what Cendebeus had done.
\v 2 Wherefore Simon called his two eldest sonnes, Iudas and Iohn, and said vnto them, I and my brethren, and my fathers house haue euer from our youth vnto this day fought against the enemies of Israel, and things haue prospered so well in our hands, that wee haue deliuered Israel oftentimes.
\v 3 But now I am old, and yee [by Gods mercy] are of a sufficient age: Be ye in stead of mee, and my brother, and goe and fight for our nation, and the helpe from heauen be with you.
\v 4 So hee chose out of the countrey twentie thousand men of warre with horsemen, who went out against Cendebeus, and rested that night at Modin.
\v 5 And when as they rose in the morning, and went into the plaine, behold, a mighty great hoste both of footmen, and horsmen, came against them: Howbeit there was a water brooke betwixt them.
\v 6 So hee and his people pitched ouer against them, and when hee saw that the people were afraid to goe ouer the water brooke, hee went first ouer himselfe, and then the men seeing him, passed through after him.
\v 7 [That done] he diuided his men, and set the horsemen in the midst of the footemen: for the enemies horsemen were very many.
\v 8 Then sounded they with the holy Trumpets: whereupon Cendebeus and his hoste were put to flight, so that many of them were slaine, and the remnant gat them to the strong hold.
\v 9 At that time was Iudas Iohns brother wounded: But Iohn still followed after them, vntill he came to Cedron which [Cendebeus] had built.
\v 10 \f + \fr 16:10 \ft Or, which when he had set fire, they fled vnto the towres in the fields of A. Lotus, and there were slaine, &c.\f*So they fled euen vnto the towres in the fields of Azotus, wherefore hee burnt it with fire: So that there were slaine of them about two thousand men. Afterward hee returned into the land of Iudea in peace.
\v 11 Moreouer, in the plaine of Iericho was Ptolomeus the sonne of Abubus made captaine, and hee had abundance of siluer and golde.
\v 12 For he was the hie Priests sonne in lawe.
\v 13 Wherefore his heart being lifted vp, hee thought to get the countrey to himselfe, and thereupon consulted deceitfully against Simon and his sons, to destroy them.
\v 14 Now Simon was visiting the cities that were in the countrey, and taking care for the good ordering of them, at which time hee came downe himselfe to Iericho with his sons, Mattathias and Iudas, in the hundreth threescore and seuenth yeere, in the eleuenth moneth called Sabat.
\v 15 Where the sonne of Abubus receiuing them deceitfully into a little holde called Docus, which he had built, made them a great banquet: howbeit he had hidde men there.
\v 16 So when Simon and his sonnes had drunke largely, Ptolome and his men rose vp, and tooke their weapons, and came vpon Simon into the banketting place, and slewe him and his two sonnes, and certaine of his seruants.
\v 17 In which doing, he committed a great treachery, and recompensed euill for good.
\v 18 Then Ptolome wrote these things, and sent to the king, that he should send him an hoste to aide him, and he would deliuer him the countrey and cities.
\v 19 He sent others also to Gazara to kill Iohn, & vnto the \f + \fr 16:19 \ft Gr. captaines of thousands.\f*tribunes he sent letters to come vnto him, that he might giue them siluer, and golde, & rewards.
\v 20 And others he sent to take Ierusalem, and the mountaine of the temple.
\v 21 Now one had runne afore to Gazara, and tolde Iohn that his father and brethren were slaine, and [quoth he] Ptolome hath sent to slay thee also.
\v 22 Hereof when he heard, hee was sore astonished: So he laide hands on them that were come to destroy him, and slew them, for hee knew that they sought to make him away.
\v 23 As concerning the rest of the actes of Iohn, and his wars & worthy deeds which hee did, and the building of the walles which he made, and his doings,
\v 24 Behold, these are written in the Chronicles of his Priesthood, from the time he was made high Priest after his father.
