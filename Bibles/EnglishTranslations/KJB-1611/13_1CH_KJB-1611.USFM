\iex 1 Dauid fetcheth the Arke with great solemnitie from Kiriath-iearim. 9 Vzza being smitten, the Arke is left at the house of Obed-Edom.
\v 1 ¶ And Dauid consulted with the captaines of thousands, and hundreds, \add and\add* with euery leader.
\v 2 And Dauid said vnto all the Congregation of Israel, If it seeme good vnto you, and \add that it be\add* of the \nd LORD\nd* our God, \f + \fr 13:2 \ft Hebr. let vs breake foorth and send.\f*let vs send abroad vnto our brethren euery where, \add that are\add* left in all the land of Israel, and with them \add also\add* to the Priests and Leuites \add which are\add* in \f + \fr 13:2 \ft Hebr. in the cities of their suburbs.\f*their cities \add and\add* suburbs, that they may gather themselues vnto vs.
\v 3 And let vs \f + \fr 13:3 \ft Heb. bring about.\f*bring againe the Arke of our God to vs: for wee enquired not at it in the dayes of Saul.
\v 4 And all the Congregation saide, that they would doe so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.
\v 5 So \x + \xo 13:5 \xt 1.Sam. 7.1. 2.sam. 6.2.\x*Dauid gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt, euen vnto the entring of Hemath, to bring the Arke of God from Kiriath-iearim.
\v 6 And Dauid went vp, and all Israel, to \x + \xo 13:6 \xt Iosh. 16.9.\x*Baalah, \add that is\add*, to Kiriath-iearim, which \add belonged\add* to Iudah, to bring vp thence the Arke of God the \nd LORD\nd*, that dwelleth betweene the Cherubims, whose name is called \add on it\add*.
\v 7 And they \f + \fr 13:7 \ft Heb. made the Arke to ride.\f*caried the Arke of God in a new cart, out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza, and Ahio draue the cart.
\v 8 And Dauid and all Israel played before God with all \add their\add* might, and with \f + \fr 13:8 \ft Heb. songs.\f*singing, and with harpes, and with psalteries, and with tymbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.
\v 9 ¶ And when they came vnto the threshing floore of \x + \xo 13:9 \xt Called Nachon, 2.Sam. 6.6.\x*Chidon, Uzza put foorth his hand to hold the Arke, for the oxen\f + \fr 13:9 \ft Or, shooke it.\f*stumbled.
\v 10 And the anger of the \nd LORD\nd* was kindled against Uzza, and hee smote him, because hee put his hand to the \x + \xo 13:10 \xt Num. 4.15.\x*Arke: and there he died before God.
\v 11 And Dauid was displeased, because the \nd LORD\nd* had made a breach vpon Uzza; wherefore that place is called \f + \fr 13:11 \ft Heb. breach of Vzza.\f*Perez-Uzza, to this day.
\v 12 And Dauid was afraide of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the Arke of God \add home\add* to me?
\v 13 So Dauid \f + \fr 13:13 \ft Hebr. remooued.\f*brought not the Arke \add home\add* to himselfe to the city of Dauid, but caried it aside into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite.
\v 14 And the Arke of God remained with the family of Obed-Edom in his house three moneths. And the \nd LORD\nd* blessed \x + \xo 13:14 \xt As chap. 26.5.\x*the house of Obed-Edom, and all that he had.

\v 2 And Dauid perceiued that the \nd LORD\nd* had confirmed him king ouer Israel, for his kingdome was lift vp on high, because of his people Israel.
\v 3 ¶ And Dauid tooke \f + \fr 14:3 \ft Hebr. yet.\f*moe wiues at Ierusalem: and Dauid begate moe sonnes and daughters.
\v 4 Now these \add are\add* the names of \add his\add* children which hee had in Ierusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,

\v 8 ¶ And when the Philistines heard that \x + \xo 14:8 \xt 2.Sam. 5.17.\x*Dauid was anoynted king ouer all Israel, all the Philistines went vp to seeke Dauid: and Dauid heard \add of it\add*, and went out against them.
\v 9 And the Philistines came & spread themselues in the valley of Rephaim.
\v 10 And Dauid enquired of God, saying, Shall I goe vp against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliuer them into mine hand? And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto him, Go vp, for I will deliuer them into thine hand.
\v 11 So they came vp to Baal-Perazim, and Dauid smote them there. Then Dauid said, God hath broken in vpon mine enemies by mine hand, like the breaking foorth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place, \f + \fr 14:11 \ft Heb. that is a place of breaches.\f*Baal-Perazim.
\v 12 And when they had left their gods there, Dauid gaue a commandement, and they were burnt with fire.
\v 13 And the Philistines yet againe spread themselues abroad in the valley.
\v 14 Therfore Dauid enquired againe of God, and God said vnto him, Goe not vp after them, turne away from them, \x + \xo 14:14 \xt 2.Sam. 5.23.\x*and come vpon them ouer against the mulbery trees.
\v 15 And it shall bee, when thou shalt heare a sound of going in the tops of the mulbery trees, \add that\add* then thou shalt goe out to battaile: for God is gone foorth before thee, to smite the hoste of the Philistines.
\v 16 Dauid therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the hoste of the Philistines from Gibeon euen to Gazer.
\v 17 And the fame of Dauid went out into all lands, and the \nd LORD\nd* brought the feare of him vpon all nations.

\iex 1 Dauid hauing prepared a place for the Arke, ordereth the Priestes and Leuites to bring it from Obed-Edom. 25 Hee perfourmeth the solemnitie thereof with great ioy. 29 Michal despiseth him.
\v 1 ¶ And \add Dauid\add* made him houses in the citie of Dauid, and prepared a place for the Arke of God, and pitched for it a tent.
\v 2 Then Dauid sayd, \f + \fr 15:2 \ft Heb. It is not to cary the Arke of God, but for the Leuites.\f*None ought to carie the \x + \xo 15:2 \xt Num. 4.2,15.\x*Arke of God, but the Leuites: for them hath the \nd LORD\nd* chosen to cary the Arke of God, and to minister vnto him for euer.
\v 3 And Dauid gathered all Israel together to Ierusalem, to bring vp the Arke of the \nd LORD\nd* vnto his place, which hee had prepared for it.
\v 4 And Dauid assembled the children of Aaron, and the Leuites.

\v 10 Of the sonnes of Uzziel: Amminadab the chiefe, and his brethren an hundred and twelue.
\v 11 And Dauid called for Zadok and Abiathar the Priests, and for the Leuites, for Uriel, Asaiah and Ioel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,
\v 12 And said vnto them, Yee \add are\add* the chiefe of the fathers of the Leuites: sanctifie your selues \add both\add* yee and your brethren, that you may bring vp the Arke of the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, vnto \add the place that\add* I haue prepared for it.
\v 13 For because ye \add did it\add* not at the first, the \nd LORD\nd* our God made a breach vpon vs, for that we sought him not after the due order.
\v 14 So the Priestes and the Leuites sanctified themselues to bring vp the Arke of the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel.
\v 15 And the children of the Leuites bare the Arke of God vpon their shoulders, with the staues thereon, as \x + \xo 15:15 \xt Exod. 25.14.\x*Moses commanded, according to the word of the \nd LORD\nd*.

\v 27 And Dauid \add was\add* clothed with a robe of fine linnen, and all the Leuites that bare the Arke, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the \f + \fr 15:27 \ft Or, cariage\f*song, with the singers. Dauid also \add had\add* vpon him, an Ephod of linnen.
\v 28 Thus all Israel brought vp the Arke of the Couenant of the \nd LORD\nd* with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harpes.
\v 29 ¶ And it came to passe \add as\add* the Arke of the couenant of the \nd LORD\nd* came to the citie of Dauid, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window, saw King Dauid dauncing and playing: and shee despised him in her heart.

\iex 1 Nathan first approouing the purpose of Dauid, to build God an house, 3 after by the word of God forbiddeth him. 11 Hee promiseth him blessings and benefits in his seed. 16 Dauids prayer and thankesgiuing.
\v 1 ¶ Now \x + \xo 17:1 \xt 2.Sam. 7.1, &c.\x*it came to passe, as Dauid sate in his house, that Dauid sayde to Nathan the Prophet, Loe, I dwell in an house of Cedars, but the Arke of the Couenant of the \nd LORD\nd* \add remaineth\add* vnder curtaines.
\v 2 Then Nathan sayd vnto Dauid, Doe all that \add is\add* in thine heart, for God \add is\add* with thee.
\v 3 ¶ And it came to passe the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,
\v 4 Goe and tell Dauid my seruant, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in.
\v 5 For I haue not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought vp Israel, vnto this day, but \f + \fr 17:5 \ft Heb. haue bene.\f*haue gone from tent to tent, and from \add one\add* Tabernacle \add to another\add*.
\v 6 Wheresoeuer I haue walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the Iudges of Israel (whom I commanded to feed my people) saying, Why haue ye not built me an house of Cedars?
\v 7 Now therefore thus shalt thou say vnto my seruant Dauid, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, I tooke thee from the Sheep-coat, \add euen\add* \f + \fr 17:7 \ft Heb. from after.\f*from folowing the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler ouer my people Israel:
\v 8 And I haue bene with thee whithersoeuer thou hast walked, and haue cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and haue made thee a name, like the name of the great men that \add are\add* in the earth.
\v 9 Also I will ordeine a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moued no more: neither shal the children of wickednesse waste them any more (as at the beginning,
\v 10 And since the time that I commanded Iudges \add to bee\add* ouer my people Israel.) Moreouer, I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tel thee, that the \nd LORD\nd* will build thee an house.
\v 11 ¶ And it shall come to passe, when thy dayes be expired, that thou must go \add to be\add* with thy fathers, that I will raise vp thy seed after thee, which shall bee of thy sonnes, and I wil stablish his kingdome.
\v 12 He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for euer.
\v 13 I \x + \xo 17:13 \xt 2.King. 9.14.\x*will be his father, and he shall be my sonne, and I will not take my mercie away from him, as I tooke \add it\add* from \add him\add* that was before thee.
\v 14 But I will settle him in mine house, and in my kingdom for euer, and his throne shall bee established for euermore.
\v 15 According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speake vnto Dauid.
\v 16 ¶ And Dauid the king came, and sate before the \nd LORD\nd*, and said, Who \add am\add* I, O \nd LORD\nd* God, and what \add is\add* mine house, that thou hast brought mee hitherto?
\v 17 And \add yet\add* this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God: for thou hast \add also\add* spoken of thy seruants house, for a great while to come, and hast regarded mee according to the estate of a man of high degree, O \nd LORD\nd* God.
\v 18 What can Dauid speake more to thee for the honour of thy seruant? for thou knowest thy seruant.
\v 19 O \nd LORD\nd*, for thy seruants sake, and according to thine owne heart, hast thou done all this greatnesse in making knowen all \add these\add* \f + \fr 17:19 \ft Heb. greatnesses.\f*great things.
\v 20 O \nd LORD\nd*, \add there is\add* none like thee neither \add is there any\add* God besides thee, according to all that we haue heard with our eares.
\v 21 And what one nation in the earth \add is\add* like thy people Israel, whome God went to redeeme \add to be\add* his owne people, to make thee a name of greatnesse and terriblenesse, by driuing out nations from before thy people whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?
\v 22 For thy people Israel didst thou make thine owne people for euer, and thou, \nd LORD\nd*, becamest their God.
\v 23 Therefore now \nd LORD\nd*, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy seruant, and concerning his house, be established for euer, and doe as thou hast said.
\v 24 Let it euen bee established, that thy name may bee magnified for euer, saying, The \nd LORD\nd* of hosts \add is\add* the God of Israel, \add euen\add* a God to Israel: and \add let\add* the house of Dauid thy seruant \add be\add* established before thee.
\v 25 For thou, O my God, \f + \fr 17:25 \ft Heb. hast reuealed the eare of thy seruant.\f*hast tolde thy seruant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy seruant hath found \add in his heart\add* to pray before thee.
\v 26 And now, \nd LORD\nd* (thou art God, and hast promised this goodnesse vnto thy seruant.)
\v 27 Now therefore \f + \fr 17:27 \ft Or, it hath pleased thee.\f*let it please thee to blesse the house of thy seruant, that it may bee before thee for euer: for thou blessest, O \nd LORD\nd*, and it shalbe blessed for euer.

\v 1 ¶ Now after this, \x + \xo 18:1 \xt 2.Sam. 8.1. &c.\x*it came to passe, that Dauid smote the Philistines & subdued them, and tooke Gath, and her townes out of the hand of the Philistines.

\v 4 And Dauid tooke from him a thousand charets, and seuen thousand horsemen, and twentie thousand footmen: Dauid also houghed all the charet \add horses\add*, but reserued of them an hundred charets.
\v 5 And when the Syrians of \f + \fr 18:5 \ft Heb. Darmesek.\f*Damascus came to helpe Hadarezer king of Zobah, Dauid slew of the Syrians two and twentie thousand men.
\v 6 Then Dauid put garisons in Syria Damascus, \add and\add* the Syrians became Dauids seruants, and brought giftes. Thus the \nd LORD\nd* preserued Dauid, whithersoeuer he went.
\v 7 And Dauid tooke the shields of golde that were on the seruants of Hadarezer, & brought them to Ierusalem.
\v 8 Likewise from \f + \fr 18:8 \ft Called in the booke of Sam. Beta and Berothai.\f*Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, broght Dauid very much brasse, wherewith \x + \xo 18:8 \xt 1.King. 7.23. and 2.Chro. 4.15.\x*Solomon made the brasen Sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brasse.

\v 12 Moreouer, Abishai the sonne of Zeruiah, slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt, eighteene thousand.

\iex 1 Dauids messengers sent to comfort Hanun the sonne of Nahash, are villanously intreated. 6 The Ammonites strengthened by the Syrians, are ouercome by Ioab and Abishai. 16 Shophach making a new supply of the Syrians, is slaine by Dauid.
\v 1 ¶ Now \x + \xo 19:1 \xt 2.Sam. 10.1, &c.\x*it came to passe after this, that Nahash the King of the children of Ammon dyed, & his sonne reigned in his stead.
\v 2 And Dauid sayde, I will shewe kindnesse vnto Hanun the sonne of Nahash, because his father shewed kindnesse to mee. And Dauid sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the seruants of Dauid came into the land of the children of Ammon, to Hanun, to comfort him.
\v 3 But the Princes of the children of Ammon sayde to Hanun, \f + \fr 19:3 \ft Heb. In thine eyes doeth Dauid, &c.\f*Thinkest thou that Dauid doeth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters vnto thee? Are not his seruants come vnto thee for to search, and to ouerthrow, and to spie out the land?
\v 4 Wherefore Hanun tooke Dauids seruants, and shaued them, and cut off their garments in the middest, hard by their buttockes, and sent them away.
\v 5 Then there went certeine, and told Dauid, how the men were serued, and hee sent to meet them (for the men were greatly ashamed) and the King sayde, Tary at Iericho vntill your beards be growen, and \add then\add* returne.
\v 6 ¶ And when the children of Ammon sawe, that they had made themselues \f + \fr 19:6 \ft Heb. to stinke.\f*odious to Dauid; Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of siluer, to hire them charets and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria-Maachah, and out of Zobah.
\v 7 So they hired thirtie and two thousand charets, and the king of Maachah and his people, who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselues together from their cities, and came to battaile.
\v 8 And when Dauid heard \add of it\add*, hee sent Ioab, and all the host of the mightie men.
\v 9 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battell in aray before the gate of the citie, and the kings that were come, \add were\add* by themselues in the field.
\v 10 Now when Ioab saw that \f + \fr 19:10 \ft Hebr. the face of the battell was.\f*the battell was set against him, before and behinde: hee chose out of all the \f + \fr 19:10 \ft Or, yong men.\f*choice of Israel, and put \add them\add* in aray against the Syrians.
\v 11 And the rest of the people hee deliuered vnto the hand of \f + \fr 19:11 \ft Hebr Abshai.\f*Abishai his brother, and they set \add themselues\add* in aray against the children of Ammon.
\v 12 And he said, If the Syrians bee too strong for me, then thou shalt helpe me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I wil helpe thee.
\v 13 Be of good courage, and let vs behaue our selues valiantly for our people, and for the Cities of our God: and let the \nd LORD\nd* do \add that which is\add* good in his sight.
\v 14 So Ioab and the people that \add were\add* with him, drew nigh before the Syrians, vnto the battell; and they fled before him.
\v 15 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entred into the city. Then Ioab came to Ierusalem.
\v 16 ¶ And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians, that \add were\add* beyond the \f + \fr 19:16 \ft i.Euphrates.\f*Riuer: and \f + \fr 19:16 \ft Or Shobach, \xt 2.sam. 10.16.\f*Shophach the captaine of the hoste of Hadarezer, \add went\add* before them.
\v 17 And it was tolde Dauid, and hee gathered all Israel, and passed ouer Iordane, and came vpon them, and set the battell in aray against them: so when Dauid had put the battell in aray against the Syrians, they fought with him.
\v 18 But the Syrians fled before Israel, and Dauid slew of the Syrians seuen thousand men, which fought in charets, and fourty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captaine of the hoste.
\v 19 And when the seruants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with Dauid, and became his seruants: neither would the Syrians helpe the children of Ammon any more.

\v 2 And Dauid \x + \xo 20:2 \xt 2.Sam. 12.26.\x*tooke the crowne of their king from off his head, and found it \f + \fr 20:2 \ft Hebr. the weight of.\f*to weigh a talent of gold, and \add there were\add* precious stones in it, and it was set vpon Dauids head; and hee brought also exceeding much spoile out of the city.

\iex 1 Dauid tempted by Satan, forceth Ioab to number the people. 5 The number of the people being brought, Dauid repenteth of it. 9 Dauid hauing three plagues propounded by Gad, chuseth the pestilence. 14 After the death of 70000, Dauid by repentance preuenteth the destruction of Ierusalem. 18 Dauid by Gads direction, purchaseth Ornans threshing floore, where hauing built an Altar, God giueth a signe of his fauour by fire, and stayeth the plague. 28 Dauid sacrificeth there, being restrained from Gibeon by feare of the Angel.
\v 1 ¶ And \x + \xo 21:1 \xt 2.Sam. 24.1, &c.\x*Satan stoode vp against Israel, and prouoked Dauid to number Israel.
\v 2 And Dauid saide to Ioab, and to the rulers of the people, Goe, number Israel from Beer-sheba eueu to Dan: and bring the number of them to me, that I may know \add it\add*.
\v 3 And Ioab answered, The \nd LORD\nd* make his people an hundred times so many moe as they \add bee\add*: but, my lord the king, \add are\add* they not al my lords seruants? why then doeth my lord require this thing? why will hee bee a cause of trespasse to Israel?
\v 4 Neuerthelesse, the kings word preuailed against Ioab: wherefore Ioab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Ierusalem.
\v 5 ¶ And Ioab gaue the summe of the number of the people vnto Dauid: and all \add they of\add* Israel were a thousand thousand, and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Iudah \add was\add* foure hundred threescore and ten thousand men, that drew sword.
\v 6 But Leui and Beniamin counted hee not among them: for the kings word was abominable to Ioab.

\v 11 So Gad came to Dauid, and said vnto him, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, \f + \fr 21:11 \ft Hebr. take to thee.\f*Choose thee
\v 12 Either three yeeres famine, or three moneths to bee destroyed before thy foes (while that the sword of thine enemies ouertaketh \add thee\add*) or else three dayes the sword of the \nd LORD\nd*, euen the pestilence in the land, and the Angel of the \nd LORD\nd* destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel.

\v 13 And Dauid said vnto Gad, I am in a great strait. Let mee fall now into the hand of the \nd LORD\nd* (for very \f + \fr 21:13 \ft Or, many.\f*great \add are\add* his mercies,) but let me not fall into the hand of man.
\v 14 ¶ So the \nd LORD\nd* sent pestilence vpon Israel: and there fell of Israel, seuentie thousand men.
\v 15 And God sent an \x + \xo 21:15 \xt 2.Sam. 24.16.\x*Angel vnto Ierusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the \nd LORD\nd* beheld, and he repented him of the euill, and said to the Angel that destroyed, It is ynough, stay now thine hand. And the Angel of the \nd LORD\nd* stood by the threshing floore of \f + \fr 21:15 \ft Or, Araunah. \xt 2.sam. 24.18.\f*Ornan the Iebusite.
\v 16 And Dauid lift vp his eyes, and saw the Angel of the \nd LORD\nd* stand betweene the earth and the heauen, hauing a drawen sword in his hand stretched out ouer Ierusalem. Then Dauid and the Elders \add of Israel, who were\add* clothed in sackecloth, fell vpon their faces.
\v 17 And Dauid said vnto God, \add Is it\add* not I \add that\add* commanded the people to be numbred? euen I it is that haue sinned, and done euill indeed, but \add as for\add* these sheepe, what haue they done? Let thine hand, I pray thee, O \nd LORD\nd* my God, be on me, and on my fathers house, but not on thy people, that they should bee plagued.
\v 18 ¶ Then the \x + \xo 21:18 \xt 2.Chron. 3.1.\x*Angel of the \nd LORD\nd* commanded Gad to say to Dauid, that Dauid should goe vp and set vp an Altar vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, in the threshing floore of Ornan the Iebusite.
\v 19 And Dauid went vp at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the Name of the \nd LORD\nd*.

\v 21 And as Dauid came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw Dauid, and went out of the threshing floore, and bowed himselfe to Dauid with \add his\add* face to the ground.
\v 22 Then Dauid saide to Ornan, \f + \fr 21:22 \ft Heb. giue.\f*Grant mee the place of \add this\add* threshing floore, that I may build an Altar therein vnto the \nd LORD\nd*: thou shalt grant it mee for the full price, that the plague may be stayed from the people.
\v 23 And Ornan saide vnto Dauid, Take \add it\add* to thee, and let my lord the king do \add that which is\add* good in his eyes. Loe, I giue \add thee\add* the oxen \add also\add* for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meate offering, I giue it all.
\v 24 And king Dauid said to Ornan; Nay, but I wil verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take \add that\add* which \add is\add* thine for the \nd LORD\nd*, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.
\v 25 So \x + \xo 21:25 \xt 2.Sam. 24.24.\x*Dauid gaue to Ornan for the place, sixe hundred shekels of gold by weight.
\v 26 And Dauid built there an Altar vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, and offered burnt offerings, and peace offerings, and called vpon the \nd LORD\nd*, and hee answered him from heauen by fire vpon the Altar of burnt offering.
\v 27 And the \nd LORD\nd* commaunded the Angel, and hee put vp his sword againe into the sheath thereof.
\v 28 ¶ At that time, when Dauid saw that the \nd LORD\nd* had answered him in the threshing floore of Ornan the Iebusite, then he sacrificed there.

\v 6 ¶ Then hee called for Solomon his sonne, and charged him to build an house for the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel.
\v 7 And Dauid saide to Solomon; My sonne, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house vnto the Name of the \nd LORD\nd* my God.
\v 8 But the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came to mee, saying, \x + \xo 22:8 \xt Chap. 28.3. 2.sam. 7.13.\x*Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great warres: thou shalt not build an house vnto my Name, because thou hast shed much blood vpon the earth in my sight.
\v 9 Behold, a sonne shall bee borne to thee, who shall bee a man of rest, and I will giue him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shalbe \f + \fr 22:9 \ft That is, peaceable.\f*Solomon, and I wil giue peace and quietnesse vnto Israel in his dayes.
\v 10 Hee shall build an house for my Name, and he shal be my sonne, and I \add will be\add* his father, and I will establish the throne of his kingdome ouer Israel for euer.
\v 11 Now my sonne, The \nd LORD\nd* be with thee, and prosper thou, and build the house of the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, as he hath said of thee.
\v 12 Onely the \nd LORD\nd* giue thee wisedome and vnderstanding, and giue thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keepe the Law of the \nd LORD\nd* thy God.
\v 13 Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfill the Statutes and Iudgements which the \nd LORD\nd* charged Moses with, concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage, dread not, nor be dismayed.
\v 14 Now beholde, \f + \fr 22:14 \ft Or, in my pouertie.\f*in my trouble I haue prepared for the house of the \nd LORD\nd* an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of siluer, and of brasse and yron without \x + \xo 22:14 \xt As Ver.3.\x*weight: (for it is in abundance) timber also and stone haue I prepared, and thou mayest adde thereto.
\v 15 Moreouer, \add there are\add* workmen with thee in abundance, hewers, and \f + \fr 22:15 \ft That is, Masons and Carpenters.\f*workers of stone and timber, and all maner of cunning men for euery maner of worke:
\v 16 Of the gold, the siluer, and the brasse, and the yron, \add there is\add* no number. Arise \add therefore\add*, and be doing, and the \nd LORD\nd* be with thee.
\v 17 ¶ Dauid also commanded all the Princes of Israel to helpe Solomon his sonne, \add saying\add*,
\v 18 \add Is\add* \add not\add* the \nd LORD\nd* your God with you? and hath he not giuen you rest on euery side? for he hath giuen the inhabitants of the land into mine hand, and the land is subdued before the \nd LORD\nd*, and before his people.
\v 19 Now set your heart and your soule to seeke the \nd LORD\nd* your God: arise therfore, and build ye the Sanctuary of the \nd LORD\nd* God, to bring the Arke of the Couenant of the \nd LORD\nd*, & the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the Name of the \nd LORD\nd*.

\v 3 But God said vnto me, Thou shalt not builde an house for my Name, because thou \add hast been\add* a man of warre, and hast shed \f + \fr 28:3 \ft Heb. bloods\f*blood.
\v 4 Howbeit, the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel chose me before all the house of my father, to be king ouer Israel for euer: for he hath chosen \x + \xo 28:4 \xt Gen. 49.8. 1.sam. 16.13. psal. 78.67.\x*Iudah \add to be\add* the ruler; & of the house of Iudah, the house of my father; and among the sonnes of my father, he liked \add me\add* to make me king ouer all Israel:

\v 6 And he said vnto me, \x + \xo 28:6 \xt 2.Sam. 7.13. 2.chro. 1.9.\x*Solomon thy sonne, hee shall build my house and my courts: for I haue chosen him \add to be\add* my sonne, and I will be his father.
\v 7 Moreouer, I will establish his kingdome for euer, if he be \f + \fr 28:7 \ft Heb. strong\f*constant to do my commandements and my iudgements, as at this day.
\v 8 Now therefore in the sight of all Israel, the congregation of the \nd LORD\nd*, and in the audience of our God, keepe, and seeke for all the commandements of the \nd LORD\nd* your God, that ye may possesse this good land, and leaue \add it\add* for an inheritance for your children after you, for euer.

\v 10 Take heed now, for the \nd LORD\nd* hath chosen thee to builde an house for the Sanctuarie: be strong, and doe \add it\add*.

\iex 1 Dauid by his example and intreatie, 6 causeth the Princes and people to offer willingly. 10 Dauids thankesgiuing and prayer. 20 The people hauing blessed God and sacrificed, make Solomon King. 26 Dauids reigne and death.
\v 1 ¶ Furthermore, Dauid the King said vnto all the congregation, Solomon my sonne, whome alone God hath chosen, \add is yet\add* \x + \xo 29:1 \xt Cha. 22.5.\x*young and tender, and the worke \add is\add* great: for the palace \add is\add* not for man, but for the \nd LORD\nd* God.
\v 2 Now I haue prepared with all my might for the house of my God, the gold for \add things to be made\add* of gold, the siluer for \add things\add* of siluer, and the brasse for \add things\add* of brasse, the yron for \add things\add* of yron, and wood for \add things\add* of wood, onix \add stones\add*, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of diuers colours, and all maner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.
\v 3 Moreouer, because I haue set my affection to the house of my God, I haue of mine owne proper good, of gold and siluer, \add which\add* I haue giuen to the house of my God, ouer & aboue all that I haue prepared for the holy house:

And who \add then\add* is willing \f + \fr 29:5 \ft Hebr. to fill his hand.\f*to consecrate his seruice this day vnto the \nd LORD\nd*?
\v 6 ¶ Then the chiefe of the fathers and Princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captaines of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers ouer the Kings worke, offered willingly,
\v 7 And gaue for the seruice of the house of God, of gold fiue thousand talents, and ten thousand drammes: and of siluer, ten thousand talents: and of brasse, eighteene thousand talents: and one hundred thousand talents of yron.
\v 8 And they with whom \add precious\add* stones were found, gaue \add them\add* to the treasure of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, by the hand of Iehiel the Gershonite.
\v 9 Then the people reioyced, for that they offred willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the \nd LORD\nd*: and Dauid the King also reioyced with great ioy.
\v 10 ¶ Wherefore Dauid blessed the \nd LORD\nd* before all the Congregation: and Dauid saide, Blessed \add bee\add* thou, \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel our father, for euer and euer.
\v 11 Thine, O \nd LORD\nd*, \add is\add* the greatnes, and the power, and the glory, & the victorie, and the maiestie: for all \add that is\add* in the heauen & in the earth, \add is thine\add*: thine \add is\add* \x + \xo 29:11 \xt Mat. 6.13. 1.tim. 1.17. apoc. 5.13.\x*the kingdome, O \nd LORD\nd*, and thou art exalted as head aboue all.

\v 13 Now therefore, our God, wee thanke thee, and praise thy glorious Name.
\v 14 But who \add am\add* I, and what \add is\add* my people, that we should \f + \fr 29:14 \ft Hebr. retaine or obtain strength\f*be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things \add come\add* of thee, and of \f + \fr 29:14 \ft Hebr. of thine hand.\f*thine owne haue we giuen thee.
\v 15 For we \add are\add* strangers before thee, and soiourners, as \add were\add* all our fathers: \x + \xo 29:15 \xt Psal. 39.12 and 90.9. heb. 11.13. 1.pet. 2.11.\x*Our dayes on the earth \add are\add* as a shadow, and \add there is\add* none \f + \fr 29:15 \ft Hebr. expectation.\f*abiding.
\v 16 O \nd LORD\nd* our God, all this store that we haue prepared to build thee an house for thine holy Name, commeth of thine hand, and \add is\add* all thine owne.
\v 17 I know also, my God, that thou \x + \xo 29:17 \xt Cha. 23.9. 1.Sam. 16.7.\x*triest the heart, and hast pleasure in vprightnesse. As for me, in the vprightnes of mine heart I haue willingly offered all these things: and now haue I seene with ioy, thy people which are \f + \fr 29:17 \ft Heb. found\f*present here, to offer willingly vnto thee.
\v 18 O \nd LORD\nd* God of Abraham, Isaac and of Israel our fathers, keepe this for euer in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and \f + \fr 29:18 \ft Or, stablish\f*prepare their heart vnto thee:
\v 19 And giue vnto Solomon my sonne a perfect heart to keepe thy Commaundements, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to doe all \add these things\add*, and to build the pallace, \add for\add* the which I haue made prouision.
\v 20 ¶ And Dauid said to all the Congregation: Nowe blesse the \nd LORD\nd* your God. And all the Congregation blessed the \nd LORD\nd* God of their fathers, and bowed downe their heads, and worshipped the \nd LORD\nd*, and the King.
\v 21 And they sacrificed sacrifices vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, & offered burnt offerings vnto the \nd LORD\nd* on the morrow after that day, \add euen\add* a thousand bullockes, a thousand rams, \add and\add* a thousand lambes, with their drinke offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel:
\v 22 And did eate and drinke before the \nd LORD\nd* on that day with great gladnesse, and they made Solomon the sonne of Dauid King the second time, and \x + \xo 29:22 \xt 1.King. 1.33.\x*anointed \add him\add* vnto the \nd LORD\nd* \add to be\add* the chiefe gouernour, and Zadok \add to be\add* Priest.
\v 23 Then Solomon sate on the throne of the \nd LORD\nd*, as king in stead of Dauid his father, and prospered, and all Israel obeyed him.
\v 24 And all the princes and the mightie men, and all the sonnes likewise of king Dauid, \f + \fr 29:24 \ft Heb. gaue the hand vnder Solomon.\f*submitted themselues vnto Solomon the King.
\v 25 And the \nd LORD\nd* magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and \x + \xo 29:25 \xt 1.King. 3.13. 2.chro. 1.12. eccles. 2.9.\x*bestowed vpon him \add such\add* royal maiestie, as had not bene on any king before him in Israel.
\v 26 ¶ Thus Dauid the sonne of Iesse, reigned ouer all Israel.
\v 27 And the time that he reigned ouer Israel, \add was\add* fourtie yeeres. Seuen yeeres reigned hee in Hebron, and thirtie and three yeeres reigned hee in Ierusalem.
\v 28 And he died in a good old age, full of dayes, riches and honour: and Solomon his sonne reigned in his stead.
\v 29 Now the acts of Dauid the King first and last, behold, they \add are\add* written in the \f + \fr 29:29 \ft Or, historie.\f*booke of Samuel the Seer, and in the \f + \fr 29:29 \ft Hebr. words.\f*booke of Nathan the Prophet, and in the booke of Gad the Seer,
