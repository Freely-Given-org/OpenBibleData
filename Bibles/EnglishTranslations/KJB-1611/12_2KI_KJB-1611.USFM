\iex 1 Moab rebelleth. 2 Ahaziah, sending to Baalzebub, hath his iudgement by Eliiah. 5 Eliiah twise bringeth fire from heauen vpon them whom Ahaziah sent to apprehend him. 13 He pitieth the third captaine, and incouraged by an Angel, telleth the King of his death. 17 Iehoram succeedeth Ahaziah.
\v 1 ¶ Then Moab rebelled against Israel, \x + \xo 1:1 \xt Chap. 3.5.\x*after the death of Ahab.
\v 2 And Ahaziah fel downe thorow a lattesse in his vpper chamber that \add was\add* in Samaria, and was sicke: and he sent messengers, and said vnto them, Goe, enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, whether I shal recouer of this disease.
\v 3 But the Angel of the \nd LORD\nd* said to Eliiah the Tishbite, Arise, goe vp to meete the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say vnto them, \add Is it\add* not because \add there is\add* not a God in Israel, \add that\add* ye goe to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?
\v 4 Now therefore, thus sayeth the \nd LORD\nd*, \f + \fr 1:4 \ft Heb. the bed, whither thou art gone vp, thou shalt not come downe from it.\f*Thou shalt not come downe from that bed on which thou art gone vp, but shalt surely die. And Eliiah departed.
\v 5 ¶ And when the messengers turned backe vnto him, he said vnto them, Why are ye now turned backe?
\v 6 And they said vnto him, There came a man vp to meet vs, and said vnto vs, Goe, turne againe vnto the king that sent you, and say vnto him, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, \add Is it\add* not because \add there is\add* not a God in Israel, \add that\add* thou sendest to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come downe from that bedde on which thou art gone vp, but shalt surely die.
\v 7 And hee said vnto them, \f + \fr 1:7 \ft Heb. what was the maner of the man?\f*What maner of man \add was he\add* which came vp to meet you, and told you these words?
\v 8 And they answered him, \add He was\add* an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loynes: and he said, It \add is\add* Eliiah the Tishbite.
\v 9 Then the King sent vnto him a captaine of fiftie, with his fiftie: and he went vp to him, (and behold, he sate on the top of an hill) and hee spake vnto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come downe.
\v 10 And Eliiah answered, and said to the captaine of fiftie, If I \add be\add* a man of God, then let fire come downe from heauen, and consume thee and thy fiftie. And there came downe fire from heauen, and consumed him and his fiftie.
\v 11 Againe also hee sent vnto him another captaine of fiftie, with his fiftie: And hee answered, and said vnto him, O man of God, Thus hath the king said, Come downe quickly.
\v 12 And Eliiah answered, and saide vnto them, If I \add be\add* a man of God, let fire come downe from heauen, and consume thee, and thy fiftie. And the fire of God came downe from heauen, and consumed him, and his fiftie.
\v 13 ¶ And hee sent againe a captaine of the third fiftie, with his fiftie: and the third captaine of fiftie went vp, and came and \f + \fr 1:13 \ft Hebr. bowed.\f*fell on his knees before Eliiah, and besought him, and saide vnto him, Oh man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fiftie thy seruants, be precious in thy sight.
\v 14 Behold, there came fire downe from heauen, and burnt vp the two captaines of the former fifties, with their fifties: Therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight.
\v 15 And the Angel of the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Elijah, Goe downe with him, be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went downe with him vnto the king.
\v 16 And he said vnto him, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron (\add is it\add* not because \add there is\add* no God in Israel, to enquire of his word?) therefore thou shalt not come downe off that bed on which thou art gone vp, but shalt surely die.
\v 17 ¶ So he died, according to the worde of the \nd LORD\nd* which Eliiah had spoken: and Iehoram reigned in his stead, in the second yeere of Iehoram the sonne of Iehoshaphat king of Iudah, because he had no sonne.
\v 18 Now the rest of the actes of Ahaziah, which hee did, \add are\add* they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel?

\iex 1 Elijah, taking his leaue of Elisha, with his mantle diuideth Iordan, 9 and granting Elisha his request, is taken vp by a fierie charet into heauen. 12 Elisha, diuiding Iordan with Elijahs mantle, is acknowledged his successor. 16 The young prophets, hardly obtaining leaue to seeke Elijah, could not finde him. 19 Elisha with salt, healeth the vnwholesome waters. 23 Beares destroy the children that mocked Elisha.
\v 1 ¶ And it came to passe when the \nd LORD\nd* would take vp Elijah into heauen by a whirlewinde, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.
\v 2 And Elijah said vnto Elisha, Tarie here, I pray thee: for the \nd LORD\nd* hath sent me to Bethel: and Elisha said vnto him, As the \nd LORD\nd* liueth, and as thy soule liueth, I wil not leaue thee. So they went downe to Bethel.
\v 3 And the sonnes of the Prophets that \add were\add* at Bethel, came foorth to Elisha, and said vnto him, Knowest thou that the \nd LORD\nd* will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know \add it\add*, hold you your peace.
\v 4 And Elijah said vnto him, Elisha, tarie here, I pray thee: for the \nd LORD\nd* hath sent me to Iericho: And hee said, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liueth, and \add as\add* thy soule liueth, I will not leaue thee. So they came to Iericho.
\v 5 And the sonnes of the Prophets that \add were\add* at Iericho came to Elisha, and said vnto him, Knowest thou that the \nd LORD\nd* will take away thy master from thy head to day? And hee answered, Yea, I knowe \add it\add*, holde you your peace.
\v 6 And Elijah said vnto him, Tarie, I pray thee, here: for the \nd LORD\nd* hath sent me to Iordan. And he said, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liueth, and \add as\add* thy soule liueth, I will not leaue thee. And they two went on.
\v 7 And fiftie men of the sonnes of the Prophets went, and stood \f + \fr 2:7 \ft Hebr. in sight, or ouer against.\f*to view afarre off: and they two stood by Iordan.
\v 8 And Elijah tooke his mantle, and wrapt \add it\add* together, and smote the waters, and they were diuided hither and thither, so that they two went ouer on drie ground.
\v 9 ¶ And it came to passe when they were gone ouer, that Elijah said vnto Elisha, Aske what I shall doe for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be vpon me.
\v 10 And hee said, \f + \fr 2:10 \ft Hebr. thou hast done hard in asking.\f*Thou hast asked a hard thing: neuerthelesse, if thou see me, \add when I am\add* taken from thee, it shall be \add so\add* vnto thee: but if not, it shall not be so.
\v 11 And it came to passe as they still went on and talked, that beholde, \add there appeared\add* a charet of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder, and \x + \xo 2:11 \xt Ecclus. 48.9. 1.Mac. 2.58.\x*Elijah went vp by a whirlewind into heauen.
\v 12 ¶ And Elisha saw \add it\add*, and he cried, \x + \xo 2:12 \xt Chap. 13.14.\x*My father, my father, the charet of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he tooke hold of his owne cloathes, and rent them in two pieces.
\v 13 He tooke vp also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the \f + \fr 2:13 \ft Hebr. lip.\f*banke of Iordan.
\v 14 And he tooke the mantle of Eliiah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where \add is\add* the \nd LORD\nd* God of Elijah? And when hee also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went ouer.
\v 15 And when the sonnes of the Prophets which \add were\add* \x + \xo 2:15 \xt Verse 7.\x*to view at Iericho, saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha: And they came to meet him, and bowed themselues to the ground before him.
\v 16 ¶ And they said vnto him, Behold now, there bee with thy seruants fiftie \f + \fr 2:16 \ft Hebr. sonnes of strength.\f*strong men, let them goe, we pray thee, and seeke thy master: lest peraduenture the Spirit of the \nd LORD\nd* hath taken him vp, and cast him vpon \f + \fr 2:16 \ft Hebr. one of the mountaines.\f*some mountaine, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.
\v 17 And when they vrged him, till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fiftie men, and they sought three dayes, but found him not.
\v 18 And when they came againe to him (for he taried at Iericho) hee said vnto them, Did I not say vnto you, Goe not?
\v 19 ¶ And the men of the city said vnto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city \add is\add* pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water \add is\add* nought, and the ground \f + \fr 2:19 \ft Hebr. causing to miscary.\f*barren.
\v 20 And hee said, Bring mee a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought \add it\add* to him.
\v 21 And he went forth vnto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, I haue healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death, or barren \add land\add*.
\v 22 So the waters were healed vnto this day, according to the saying of Elisha, which he spake.
\v 23 ¶ And he went vp from thence vnto Bethel: and as hee was going vp by the way, there came foorth little children out of the citie, and mocked him, and said vnto him, Goe vp thou bald head, Goe vp thou bald head.
\v 24 And hee turned backe, and looked on them, and cursed them in the Name of the \nd LORD\nd*: and there came foorth two shee Beares out of the wood, and tare fortie and two children of them.
\v 25 And hee went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.

\iex 1 Iehorams reigne. 4 Mesha rebelleth. 6 Iehoram, with Iehoshaphat, and the king of Edom, being distressed for want of water, by Elisha obtaineth water, and promise of victory. 21 The Moabites deceiued by the colour of the water, comming to spoile, are ouercome. 26 The king of Moab, by sacrificing the king of Edoms sonne, raiseth the siege.
\v 1 ¶ Now Iehoram the sonne of Ahab began to reigne ouer Israel in Samaria, the eighteenth yere of Iehoshaphat king of Iudah, and reigned twelue yeeres.
\v 2 And he wrought euill in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, but not like his father and like his mother; for hee put away the \f + \fr 3:2 \ft Hebr. statue.\f*image of Baal that his father had made.
\v 3 Neuerthelesse, hee cleaued vnto the sinnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, which made Israel to sinne; he departed not therefrom.
\v 4 ¶ And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepe-master, and rendred vnto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambes, and an hundred thousand rammes, with the wooll.
\v 5 But it came to passe when \x + \xo 3:5 \xt Chap. 1.1.\x*Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
\v 6 ¶ And king Iehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbred all Israel.
\v 7 And he went, and sent to Iehoshaphat the King of Iudah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against mee: Wilt thou goe with mee against Moab to battell? and he said, I will goe vp: \x + \xo 3:7 \xt 1.King. 22.4.\x*I \add am\add* as thou \add art\add*, my people as thy people, \add and\add* my horses as thy horses.
\v 8 And he said, Which way shall we goe vp? And he answered, The way through the wildernesse of Edom.
\v 9 So the king of Israel went, and the king of Iudah, and the king of Edom: and they fetcht a compasse of seuen dayes iourney: and there was no water for the hoste, and for the cattell \f + \fr 3:9 \ft Hebr. at their feet.\f*that followed them.
\v 10 And the king of Israel said, Alas, that the \nd LORD\nd* hath called these three kings together, to deliuer them into the hand of Moab.
\v 11 But Iehoshaphat said, \add Is there\add* not here a Prophet of the \nd LORD\nd*, that we may enquire of the \nd LORD\nd* by him? And one of the king of Israels seruants answered, and said, Here \add is\add* Elisha the sonne of Shaphat, which powred water on the hands of Eliiah.
\v 12 And Iehoshaphat saide, The word of the \nd LORD\nd* is with him. So the king of Israel, & Iehoshaphat, and the king of Edom went downe to him.
\v 13 And Elisha saide vnto the king of Israel, What haue I to doe with thee? Get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said vnto him, Nay: for the \nd LORD\nd* hath called these three kings together, to deliuer them into the hand of Moab.
\v 14 And Elisha said, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* of hostes liueth, before whom I stand, Surely were it not that I regard the presence of Iehoshaphat the King of Iudah, I would not looke toward thee, nor see thee.
\v 15 But now bring me a minstrell. And it came to passe when the minstrell played, that the hand of the \nd LORD\nd* came vpon him.
\v 16 And hee sayde, Thus sayth the \nd LORD\nd*, Make this valley full of ditches.
\v 17 For thus sayth the \nd LORD\nd*, Yee shall not see winde, neither shall ye see raine, yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drinke, both ye, and your cattell, and your beasts.
\v 18 And this is \add but\add* a light thing in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, he will deliuer the Moabites also into your hand.
\v 19 And ye shall smite euery fenced citie, and euery choice citie, and shall fell euery good tree, and stop all welles of water, and \f + \fr 3:19 \ft Heb. grieue\f*marre euery good piece of land with stones.
\v 20 And it came to passe in the morning when the meate offering was offered, that behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the countrey was filled with water.
\v 21 ¶ And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come vp to fight against them, they \f + \fr 3:21 \ft Heb. were cryed together.\f*gathered all that were able to \f + \fr 3:21 \ft Heb. gird himselfe with a girdle.\f*put on armour, and vpward, and stood in the border.
\v 22 And they rose vp early in the morning, and the Sunne shone vpon the water, and the Moabites sawe the water on the other side \add as\add* red as blood.
\v 23 And they said, This \add is\add* blood: the kings are surely \f + \fr 3:23 \ft Heb. destroyed.\f*slaine, and they haue smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoile.
\v 24 And when they came to the campe of Israel, the Israelites rose vp and smote the Moabites, so that they fledde before them: but \f + \fr 3:24 \ft Or, they smote in it, euen smiting.\f*they went forward smiting the Moabites, euen in \add their\add* countrey.
\v 25 And they beat downe the cities, and on euery good piece of land cast euery man his stone, and filled it, and they stopped all the welles of water, and felled all the good trees: \f + \fr 3:25 \ft Heb. vntill he left the stones thereof in Kirharaseth.\f*onely in Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof: howbeit the slingers went about \add it\add*, and smote it.
\v 26 ¶ And when the king of Moab sawe that the battell was too sore for him, he tooke with him seuen hundred men that drewe swordes, to breake thorow \add euen\add* vnto the king of Edom: but they could not.
\v 27 Then hee tooke his eldest sonne that should haue reigned in his stead, and offered him \add for\add* a burnt offering vpon the wall: and there was great indignation against Israel, and they departed from him, and returned to their owne land.

\iex 1 Elisha multiplieth the widowes oyle. 8 Hee giueth a sonne to the good Shunammite. 18 Hee raiseth againe her dead sonne. 38 At Gilgal hee healeth the deadly pottage. 42 Hee satisfieth an hundred men with twentie loaues.
\v 1 ¶ Now there cryed a certaine woman of the wiues of the sonnes of the Prophets vnto Elisha, saying, Thy seruant my husband is dead, and thou knowest that thy seruant did feare the \nd LORD\nd*: and the creditour is come to take vnto him my two sonnes to be bondmen.
\v 2 And Elisha said vnto her, What shall I doe for thee? Tell mee, what hast thou in the house? And shee sayd, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, saue a pot of oyle.
\v 3 Then hee said, Goe, borrow thee vessels abroad, of all thy neighbours; \add euen\add* emptie vessels, \f + \fr 4:3 \ft Or, scant not.\f*borrow not a few.
\v 4 And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the doore vpon thee, and vpon thy sonnes, and shalt powre out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full.
\v 5 So shee went from him, and shut the doore vpon her, & vpon her sonnes: who brought \add the vessels\add* to her, and shee powred out.
\v 6 And it came to passe, when the vessels were full, that shee said vnto her sonne, Bring me yet a vessell. And hee said vnto her, \add There is\add* not a vessel more. And the oyle stayed.
\v 7 Then she came, and told the man of God: and he said, Goe, sell the oyle, and pay thy \f + \fr 4:7 \ft Or, creditour.\f*debt, and liue thou and thy children of the rest.
\v 8 ¶ And \f + \fr 4:8 \ft Heb. there was a day.\f*it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where \add was\add* a great woman; and shee \f + \fr 4:8 \ft Heb. laid hold on him.\f*constrained him to eate bread: And \add so\add* it was, \add that\add* as oft as he passed by, hee turned in thither to eate bread.
\v 9 And shee said vnto her husband, Behold now, I perceiue that th\add is\add* is an holy man of God, which passeth by vs continually.
\v 10 Let vs make a litle chamber, I pray thee, on the wall, and let vs set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stoole, and a candlesticke: and it shall be when he commeth to vs, that hee shall turne in thither.
\v 11 And it fell on a day that hee came thither, and hee turned into the chamber, and lay there.
\v 12 And he said to Gehazi his seruant, Call this Shunammite. And when hee had called her, she stood before him.
\v 13 And he said vnto him, Say, now vnto her, Behold, thou hast beene carefull for vs with all this care; What \add is\add* to be done for thee? Wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captaine of the hoste? And she answered, I dwell among mine owne people.
\v 14 And he said, What then \add is\add* to bee done for her? And Gehazi answered, Uerily she hath no child, and her husband is old.
\v 15 And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the doore.
\v 16 And he said, \x + \xo 4:16 \xt Gen. 18.10.\x*About this \f + \fr 4:16 \ft Heb. set time.\f*season, according to the time of life, thou shalt imbrace a sonne. And she said, Nay my lord, \add thou\add* man of God, doe not lie vnto thine handmaid.
\v 17 And the woman conceiued, and bare a sonne at that season, that Elisha had said vnto her, according to the time of life.
\v 18 ¶ And when the child was growen, it fell on a day that hee went out to his father, to the reapers.
\v 19 And he said vnto his father, My head, my head: and he said to a ladde, Carie him to his mother.
\v 20 And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, hee sate on her knees till noone, and \add then\add* died.
\v 21 And she went vp, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the doore vpon him, and went out.
\v 22 And she called vnto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the yong men, and one of the asses, that I may runne to the man of God, and come againe.
\v 23 And he said, Wherefore wilt thou goe to him to day? \add it is\add* neither newe moone nor Sabbath. And shee said, It shalbe \f + \fr 4:23 \ft Heb. peace.\f*well.
\v 24 Then she sadled an asse, and said to her seruant, Driue, and goe forward: \f + \fr 4:24 \ft Heb. restraine not for me to ride.\f*slacke not \add thy\add* riding for mee, except I bid thee.
\v 25 So she went, and came vnto the man of God to mount Carmel: and it came to passe when the man of God saw her afarre off, that hee said to Gehazi his seruant, Behold, \add yonder is\add* that Shunammite:
\v 26 Runne now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say vnto her, \add Is it\add* wel with thee? \add is it\add* wel with thy husband? \add is it\add* wel with the child? And she answered, \add It is\add* well.
\v 27 And when shee came to the man of God to the hill, shee caught \f + \fr 4:27 \ft Heb. by his feete.\f*him by the feet: but Gehazi came neere to thrust her away. And the man of God saide, Let her alone, for her soule \add is\add* \f + \fr 4:27 \ft Heb. bitter\f*vexed within her: and the \nd LORD\nd* hath hid \add it\add* from me, and hath not told me.
\v 28 Then shee said, Did I desire a sonne of my \nd LORD\nd*? did I not say, Doe not deceiue me?
\v 29 Then he said to Gehazi, Gird vp thy loines, and take my staffe in thine hand, and goe thy way: if thou meete any man, salute him not: and if any salute thee, answere him not againe: and lay my staffe vpon the face of the childe.
\v 30 And the mother of the childe said, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liueth, and \add as\add* thy soule liueth, I will not leaue thee. And he arose, and followed her.
\v 31 And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staffe vpon the face of the child, but \add there was\add* neither voyce, nor \f + \fr 4:31 \ft Heb. attention.\f*hearing: wherefore he went againe to meete him, and tolde him, saying, The child is not awaked.
\v 32 And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, \add and\add* laid vpon his bed.
\v 33 He went in therefore, and shut the doore vpon them twaine, and prayed vnto the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 34 And he went vp, and lay vpon the child, and put his mouth vpon his mouth, and his eyes vpon his eyes, and his hands vpon his hands, and he stretched himselfe vpon the child, and the flesh of the child waxed warme.
\v 35 Then he returned, and walked in the house \f + \fr 4:35 \ft Heb. once hither, and once thither.\f*to and fro, and went vp, and stretched himselfe vpon him: and the child neesed seuen times, and the child opened his eyes.
\v 36 And hee called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So hee called her: and when shee was come in vnto him, he said, Take vp thy sonne.
\v 37 Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed her selfe to the ground, and tooke vp her sonne, and went out.
\v 38 ¶ And Elisha came againe to Gilgal, and \add there was\add* a dearth in the land, and the sonnes of the Prophets \add were\add* sitting before him: and hee said vnto his seruant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sonnes of the Prophets.
\v 39 And one went out into the field to gather herbes, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wilde gourds his lap full, and came and shred \add them\add* into the pot of pottage: for they knew \add them\add* not.
\v 40 So they powred out for the men to eat: and it came to passe as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O \add thou\add* man of God, \add there is\add* death in the pot. And they could not eate \add thereof\add*.
\v 41 But he said, Then bring meale. And he cast \add it\add* into the pot: And he said, Powre out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no \f + \fr 4:41 \ft Hebr. euil thing.\f*harme in the pot.
\v 42 ¶ And there came a man from Baal-Shalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, twentie loaues of barley, and full eares of corne \f + \fr 4:42 \ft Or, in his scrip, or garment.\f*in the huske thereof: and he said, Giue vnto the people, that they may eate.
\v 43 And his seruitour saide, What should I set this before an hundred men? He said againe, Giue the people, that they may eate: for thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, \x + \xo 4:43 \xt Iohn 6.11.\x*They shall eate, and shall leaue \add thereof\add*.
\v 44 So he set \add it\add* before them, and they did eate, and left \add thereof\add*, according to the word of the \nd LORD\nd*.

\iex 1 Naaman, by the report of a captiue mayd, is sent to Samaria to be cured of his leprosie. 8 Elisha, sending him to Iordan, cureth him. 15 He refusing Naamans gifts, granteth him some of the earth. 20 Gehazi, abusing his masters name vnto Naaman, is smitten with leprosie.
\v 1 ¶ Now Naaman captaine of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man \f + \fr 5:1 \ft Hebr. before.\f*with his master, and \f + \fr 5:1 \ft Or, gracious. Hebr. lifted vp, or accepted in countenance.\f*honourable, because by him the \nd LORD\nd* had giuen \f + \fr 5:1 \ft Or, victory.\f*deliuerance vnto Syria: He was also a mighty man in valour, \add but he was\add* a leper.
\v 2 And the Syrians had gone out by companies, and had brought away captiue out of the land of Israel a litle maid, & she \f + \fr 5:2 \ft Hebr. was before.\f*waited on Naamans wife.
\v 3 And shee saide vnto her mistresse, Would God my lord \add were\add* \f + \fr 5:3 \ft Hebr. before.\f*with the Prophet that \add is\add* in Samaria, for hee would \f + \fr 5:3 \ft Hebr. gather in.\f*recouer him of his leprosie.
\v 4 And \add one\add* went in, and tolde his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the mayd that \add is\add* of the land of Israel.
\v 5 And the king of Syria said, Goe to, Goe, and I will send a letter vnto the king of Israel. And hee departed, and tooke \f + \fr 5:5 \ft Hebr. in his hand.\f*with him ten talents of siluer, and sixe thousand \add pieces\add* of gold, and ten changes of raiment.
\v 6 And hee brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come vnto thee, behold, I haue \add therewith\add* sent Naaman my seruant to thee, that thou mayest recouer him of his leprosie.
\v 7 And it came to passe when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, \add Am\add* I God, to kill and to make aliue, that this man doeth send vnto me, to recouer a man of his leprosie? Wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrell against me.
\v 8 ¶ And it was \add so\add* when Elisha the man of God had heard, that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? Let him come now to mee, and he shall know that there is a Prophet in Israel.
\v 9 So Naaman came with his horses, and with his charet, and stood at the doore of the house of Elisha.
\v 10 And Elisha sent a messenger vnto him, saying, Goe and wash in Iordane seuen times, and thy flesh shall come againe to thee, and thou shalt be cleane.
\v 11 But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and saide, Beholde, \f + \fr 5:11 \ft Hebr. said. Or, I said with my selfe, He will surely come out &c.\f*I thought, He will surely come out to me and stand, and call on the Name of the \nd LORD\nd* his God, \f + \fr 5:11 \ft Hebr. mooue vp and downe.\f*and strike his hand ouer the place, and recouer the leper.
\v 12 \add Are\add* not \f + \fr 5:12 \ft Or, Amana.\f*Abana and Pharpar, riuers of Damascus, better then all the waters of Israel? May I not wash in them, and be cleane? So he turned, and went away in a rage.
\v 13 And his seruants came neere and spake vnto him, and said, My father, If the Prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not haue done it? How much rather then, when hee saith to thee, Wash and be cleane?
\v 14 Then went he downe, and dipped himselfe seuen times in Iordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came againe like vnto the flesh of a litle childe, and \x + \xo 5:14 \xt Luke 4.27.\x*he was cleane.
\v 15 ¶ And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that \add there is\add* no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy seruant.
\v 16 But he said, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liueth, before whom I stand, I will receiue none: And hee vrged him to take \add it\add*, but he refused.
\v 17 And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be giuen to thy seruant two mules burden of earth? for thy seruant wil henceforth offer neither burnt offering, nor sacrifice vnto other gods, but vnto the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 18 In this thing the \nd LORD\nd* pardon thy seruant, \add that\add* when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and hee leaneth on my hand, and I bow myselfe in the house of Rimmon: when I bow downe my selfe in the house of Rimmon, the \nd LORD\nd* pardon thy seruant in this thing.
\v 19 *And he said vnto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him, \f + \fr 5:19 \ft Hebr. a litle piece of ground.\f*a litle way.
\v 20 ¶ But Gehazi the seruant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiuing at his hands that which hee brought: but \add as\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liueth, I wil runne after him, and take somewhat of him.
\v 21 So Gehazi followed after Naaman: and when Naaman saw \add him\add* running after him, hee lighted downe from the charet to meet him, and said, \f + \fr 5:21 \ft Hebr. Is there peace?\f*\add Is\add* all well?
\v 22 And he said, All \add is\add* well: my master hath sent me, saying, Behold, euen now there be come to mee from mount Ephraim two yong men, of the sonnes of the Prophets: Giue them, I pray thee, a talent of siluer, and two changes of garments.
\v 23 And Naaman said, Bee content, take two talents: and hee vrged him, and bound two talents of siluer in two bags, with two changes of garments, and layde \add them\add* vpon two of his seruants, and they bare \add them\add* before him.
\v 24 And when he came to the \f + \fr 5:24 \ft Or, secret place.\f*towre, he tooke \add them\add* from their hand, and bestowed \add them\add* in the house, and hee let the men goe, and they departed.
\v 25 But he went in, and stood before his master: and Elisha said vnto him, Whence commest thou, Gehazi? And hee said, Thy seruant went \f + \fr 5:25 \ft Hebr. Not hither or thither.\f*no whither.
\v 26 And he said vnto him, Went not mine heart \add with thee\add*, when the man turned againe from his charet to meete thee? \add Is it\add* a time to receiue money, and to receiue garments, and Oliue yards, and Uineyards, and sheepe, and oxen, and men seruants, and mayd seruants?
\v 27 The leprosie therefore of Naaman shall cleaue vnto thee, and vnto thy seede for euer: And hee went out from his presence a leper \add as white\add* as snow.

\iex 1 Elisha giuing leaue to the yong Prophets to inlarge their dwellings, causeth yron to swim. 8 Hee discloseth the king of Syria his counsell. 13 The armie which was sent to Dothan to apprehend Elisha, is smitten with blindnesse: 19 Being brought into Samaria, they are dismissed in peace. 24 The famine in Samaria, causeth women to eate their owne children. 30 The king sendeth to slay Elisha.
\v 1 ¶ And the sonnes of the Prophets saide vnto Elisha, Beholde now, the place where wee dwell with thee, is too strait for vs:
\v 2 Let vs goe, wee pray thee, vnto Iordane, and take thence euery man a beame, and let vs make vs a place there where we may dwell. And hee answered, Goe ye.
\v 3 And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and goe with thy seruants. And he answered, I will goe.
\v 4 So hee went with them: and when they came to Iordane, they cut downe wood.
\v 5 But as one was felling a beame, the \f + \fr 6:5 \ft Heb. yron.\f*axe head fell into the water: and hee cryed, and sayd, Alas master, for it was borrowed.
\v 6 And the man of God said, Where fell it? and hee shewed him the place: and he cut downe a sticke, and cast \add it\add* in thither, and the yron did swimme.
\v 7 Therefore said he, Take \add it\add* vp to thee: And hee put out his hand, and tooke it.
\v 8 ¶ Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and tooke counsell with his seruants, saying, In such and such a place \add shall be\add* my \f + \fr 6:8 \ft Or, encamping.\f*campe.
\v 9 And the man of God sent vnto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou passe not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come downe.
\v 10 And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God tolde him, and warned him of, and saued himselfe there, not once nor twise.
\v 11 Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing, and he called his seruants, and said vnto them, Will ye not shewe me which of vs \add is\add* for the king of Israel?
\v 12 And one of his seruants sayde, \f + \fr 6:12 \ft Heb. No.\f*None, my lord O king; but Elisha the Prophet, that \add is\add* in Israel, telleth the king of Israel, the wordes that thou speakest in thy bed-chamber.
\v 13 ¶ And he said, Goe and spie where he \add is\add*, that I may send and fetch him. And it was tolde him, saying, Behold, \add he is\add* in Dothan.
\v 14 Therefore sent he thither horses, and charets, and a \f + \fr 6:14 \ft Heb. heauie.\f*great hoste: and they came by night, and compassed the citie about.
\v 15 And when the \f + \fr 6:15 \ft Or, minister.\f*seruant of the man of God was risen early and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the citie, both with horses and charets: and his seruant said vnto him, Alas my master, how shall we doe?
\v 16 And he answered, Feare not: for \x + \xo 6:16 \xt 2.Chron. 32.7.\x*they that \add be\add* with vs, \add are\add* moe then they that \add be\add* with them.
\v 17 And Elisha prayed, and sayde, \nd LORD\nd*, I pray thee, open his eyes that he may see. And the \nd LORD\nd* opened the eyes of the young man, and hee saw: and behold, the mountaine \add was\add* full of horses, and charets of fire round about Elisha.
\v 18 And when they came downe to him, Elisha prayed vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindnesse. And hee smote them with blindnesse, according to the word of Elisha.
\v 19 ¶ And Elisha saide vnto them, Th\add is\add* \add is\add* not the way, neither is this the citie: \f + \fr 6:19 \ft Heb. come ye after me.\f*follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seeke. But hee led them to Samaria.
\v 20 And it came to passe when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, \nd LORD\nd*, open the eyes of these \add men\add*, that they may see. And the \nd LORD\nd* opened their eyes, and they saw, and beholde, \add they were\add* in the mids of Samaria.
\v 21 And the king of Israel saide vnto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite \add them\add*? shall I smite \add them\add*?
\v 22 And he answered, Thou shalt not smite \add them\add*: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captiue with thy sword, and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eate, and drinke, and go to their master.
\v 23 And hee prepared great prouision for them, and when they had eaten and drunke, hee sent them away, and they went to their master: so the bands of Syria came no more into the lande of Israel.
\v 24 ¶ And it came to passe after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his hoste, and went vp, and besieged Samaria.
\v 25 And there was a great famine in Samaria: and behold, they besieged it, vntill an asses head was solde for fourescore \add pieces\add* of siluer, and the fourth part of a kab of doues doung for fiue \add pieces\add* of siluer.
\v 26 And as the king of Israel was passing by vpon the wall, there cried a woman vnto him, saying, Helpe, my lord, O king.
\v 27 And he said, \f + \fr 6:27 \ft Or, Let not the \nd LORD\nd* saue thee\f*If the \nd LORD\nd* do not helpe thee, whence shall I helpe thee? out of the barne floore, or out of the wine presse?
\v 28 And the king said vnto her, What aileth thee? And shee answered, This woman said vnto me, Giue thy sonne, that we may eate him to day, and wee will eate my sonne to morrow.
\v 29 So \x + \xo 6:29 \xt Deut 28.53.\x*we boyled my sonne, and did eate him: and I saide vnto her on the \f + \fr 6:29 \ft Heb. other.\f*next day, Giue thy sonne, that we may eate him: and she hath hid her sonne.
\v 30 ¶ And it came to passe when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes, and hee passed by vpon the wall, and the people looked, and behold, hee had sackcloth within, vpon his flesh.
\v 31 Then he said, God doe so, and more also to mee, if the head of Elisha the sonne of Shaphat, shall stand on him this day.
\v 32 But Elisha sate in his house (and the elders sate with him) and the king sent a man from before him: but yer the messenger came to him, hee said to the Elders, See yee how this sonne of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head? Looke when the messenger commeth, shut the doore, and hold him fast at the doore: Is not the sound of his masters feete behind him?
\v 33 And while hee yet talked with them, beholde, the messenger came downe vnto him: and he said, Behold, this euill \add is\add* of the \nd LORD\nd*, what should I waite for the \nd LORD\nd* any longer?

\iex 1 Elisha prophecieth incredible plenty in Samaria. 3 Foure Lepers venturing on the host of the Syrians, bring tydings of their flight. 22 The king finding by spies the newes to be true, spoileth the tents of the Syrians. 17 The \nd LORD\nd*, who would not beleeue the prophecy of plenty, hauing the charge of the gate, is troden to death in the presse.
\v 1 ¶ Then Elisha said, Heare yee the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, To morrowe about this time shal a measure of fine flower \add be sold\add* for a shekell, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.
\v 2 Then \f + \fr 7:2 \ft Heb. a \nd LORD\nd* which belonged to the King, leaning vpon his hand.\f*a lord on whose hand the king leaned, answered the man of God, and said, Behold, \add if\add* the \nd LORD\nd* would make windowes in heauen, might this thing bee? and he saide, Behold, thou shalt see \add it\add* with thine eies, but shalt not eate thereof.
\v 3 ¶ And there were foure leprous men at the entring in of the gate: and they saide one to another, Why sit wee here vntill we die?
\v 4 If we say, We will enter into the citie, then the famine \add is\add* in the citie, and wee shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let vs fall vnto the host of the Syrians: if they saue vs aliue, we shall liue; and if they kill vs, we shall but die.
\v 5 And they rose vp in the twilight, to goe vnto the campe of the Syrians: and when they were come to the vttermost part of the campe of Syria, behold, \add there was\add* no man there.
\v 6 For the \nd LORD\nd* had made the host of the Syrians to heare a noise of charets, and a noise of horses, \add euen\add* the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Loe, the king of Israel hath hired against vs the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come vpon vs.
\v 7 Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, euen the campe as it \add was\add*, and fled for their life.
\v 8 And when these lepers came to the vttermost part of the campe, they went into one tent, and did eate, and drinke, and carried thence siluer, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid \add it\add*, and came againe, and entred into another tent, and carried thence \add also\add*, and went and hid \add it\add*.
\v 9 Then they said one to another, We doe not well: this day \add is\add* a day of good tydings, and we hold our peace: if we tarie till the morning light, \f + \fr 7:9 \ft Heb. we shall find punishment.\f*some mischiefe will come vpon vs: nowe therefore come, that we may goe, and tell the kings houshold.
\v 10 So they came, and called vnto the porter of the citie: and they told them, saying; We came to the campe of the Syrians, and behold, \add there was\add* no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tyed, and asses tyed, and the tents as they \add were\add*.
\v 11 And hee called the porters, and they told \add it\add* to the kings house within.
\v 12 ¶ And the king arose in the night, and said vnto his seruants, I will now shew you what the Syrians haue done to vs: They know that we \add be\add* hungrie, therefore are they gone out of the camp, to hide themselues in the field, saying; When they come out of the citie, we shal catch them aliue, and get into the citie.
\v 13 And one of his seruants answered, and said, Let \add some\add* take, I pray thee, fiue of the horses that remaine, which \add are\add* left \f + \fr 7:13 \ft Heb. in it.\f*in the citie: (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, \add I say\add*, they \add are\add* euen as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed) and let vs send, and see.
\v 14 They tooke therefore two charet horses, and the king sent after the hoste of the Syrians, saying, Goe, and see.
\v 15 And they went after them vnto Iordane, and loe, all the way \add was\add* full of garments, and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste: and the messengers returned, and told the king.
\v 16 And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians: So a measure of fine flowre was \add sold\add* for a shekell, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 17 ¶ And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned, to haue the charge of the gate: and the people trode vpon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came downe to him.
\v 18 And it came to passe, as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flowre for a shekel, shalbe to morrow about this time, in the gate of Samaria:
\v 19 And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now behold, \add if\add* the \nd LORD\nd* should make windowes in heauen, might such a thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eate thereof.
\v 20 And so it fell out vnto him: for the people trode vpon him in the gate, and he died.

\iex 1 The Shunammite, hauing left her countrey seuen yeeres, to auoide the forewarned famine, for Elishas miracle sake, hath her land restored by the king. 7 Hazael being sent with a present by Benhadad to Elisha at Damascus, after he had heard the prophesie, killeth his master, and succeedeth him. 16 Iehorams wicked reigne in Iudah. 20 Edom and Libnah reuolt. 23 Ahaziah succeedeth Iehoram. 25 Ahaziahs wicked reigne. 28 He visiteth Iehoram wounded, at Iezreel.
\v 1 ¶ Then spake Elisha vnto the woman ( \x + \xo 8:1 \xt Chap. 4.35.\x*whose sonne he had restored to life) saying, Arise, and goe thou and thine housholde, and soiourne whersoeuer thou canst soiourne: for the \nd LORD\nd* hath called for a famin, and it shall also come vpon the land seuen yeeres.
\v 2 And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God: and she went with her housholde, and soiourned in the land of the Philistines seuen yeeres.
\v 3 And it came to passe at the seuen yeeres ende, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went foorth to crie vnto the king for her house, and for her land.
\v 4 And the king talked with Gehazi the seruant of the man of God, saying, Tell mee, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done.
\v 5 And it came to passe as he was telling the King how hee had restored a dead body to life, that behold, the woman whose sonne he had restored to life, cryed to the King for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord O king, this \add is\add* the woman, and this \add is\add* her sonne, whom Elisha restored to life.
\v 6 And when the king asked the woman, shee tolde him. So the King appointed vnto her a certaine \f + \fr 8:6 \ft Or. Eunuch.\f*officer, saying, Restore all that \add was\add* hers, and all the fruites of the field, since the day that she left the land, euen till now.
\v 7 ¶ And Elisha came to Damascus, and Benhadad the king of Syria was sicke, and it was tolde him, saying, The man of God is come hither.
\v 8 And the king said vnto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and goe meete the man of God, and enquire of the \nd LORD\nd* by him, saying, Shall I recouer of this disease?
\v 9 So Hazael went to meete him, and tooke a present \f + \fr 8:9 \ft Heb. in his hand.\f*with him, euen of euery good thing of Damascus, fourtie camels burden, and came, and stood before him, and said, Thy sonne Benhadad king of Syria hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recouer of this disease?
\v 10 And Elisha said vnto him, Goe, say vnto him, Thou mayest certeinly recouer: howbeit, the \nd LORD\nd* hath shewed me, that he shall surely die.
\v 11 And hee setled his countenance \f + \fr 8:11 \ft Heb. and set it.\f*stedfastly, vntill he was ashamed: and the man of God wept.
\v 12 And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the euill that thou wilt doe vnto the children of Israel: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip vp their women with childe.
\v 13 And Hazael said, But what, \add is\add* thy seruant a dogge, that he should doe this great thing? And Elisha answered, The \nd LORD\nd* hath shewed mee that thou \add shalt be\add* king ouer Syria.
\v 14 So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master, who saide to him, What said Elisha to thee? and hee answered, He told me \add that\add* thou shouldst surely recouer.
\v 15 And it came to passe on the morrow, that he tooke a thicke cloth, and dipt \add it\add* in water, and spread \add it\add* on his face, so that he died, and Hazael reigned in his stead.
\v 16 ¶ And in the fifth yeere of Ioram the sonne of Ahab king of Israel, Iehoshaphat \add being\add* then king of Iudah, \x + \xo 8:16 \xt 2.Chron. 21.4.\x*Iehoram the sonne of Iehoshaphat king of Iudah \f + \fr 8:16 \ft Hebr. reigned.\f*began to reigne.
\v 17 Thirtie and two yeeres old was he when he began to reigne, and hee reigned eight yeeres in Ierusalem.
\v 18 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife, and hee did euill in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 19 Yet the \nd LORD\nd* would not destroy Iudah, for Dauid his seruants sake, \f + \fr 8:19 \ft 2.Sam. 7.13.\f*as hee promised to giue to him alway a \f + \fr 8:19 \ft Hebr. candle, or lampe.\f*light, \add and\add* to his children.
\v 20 ¶ In his dayes Edom reuolted from vnder the hand of Iudah, and made a king ouer themselues.
\v 21 So Ioram went ouer to Zair, and all the charets with him, and hee rose by night, and smote the Edomites, which compassed him about: and the captaines of the charets, and the people fled into their tents.
\v 22 Yet Edom reuolted from vnder the hand of Iudah vnto this day. Then Libnah reuolted at the same time.
\v 23 And the rest of the actes of Ioram, and all that hee did, \add are\add* they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Iudah?
\v 24 And Ioram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the citie of Dauid: And \x + \xo 8:24 \xt 2.Chron. 22.1.\x*Ahaziah his sonne reigned in his stead.
\v 25 ¶ In the twelfth yeere of Ioram the sonne of Ahab, king of Israel, did Ahaziah, the sonne of Iehoram king of Iudah, begin to reigne.
\v 26 Two and twentie yeeres old \add was\add* Ahaziah when he began to reigne, and he reigned one yeere in Ierusalem, and his mothers name \add was\add* Athaliah the daughter of Omri king of Israel.
\v 27 And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did euill in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, as \add did\add* the house of Ahab: for hee \add was\add* the sonne in law of the house of Ahab.
\v 28 ¶ And he went with Ioram the sonne of Ahab, to the warre against Hazael king of Syria in Ramoth Gilead, and the Syrians wounded Ioram.
\v 29 And king Ioram went backe to be healed in Iezreel, of the woundes \f + \fr 8:29 \ft Hebr. wherewith the Syrians had wounded.\f*which the Syrians \f + \fr 8:29 \ft Hebr. wounded.\f*had giuen him at Ramah, when hee fought against Hazael king of Syria: And Ahaziah the son of Iehoram king of Iudah, went downe to see Ioram the sonne of Ahab in Iezreel, because he was sicke.

\iex 1 Elisha sendeth a yong Prophet with instructions to annoint Iehu at Ramoth Gilead. 4 The Prophet hauing done his message, flieth. 11 Iehu being made king by the souldiers, killeth Ioram in the field of Naboth. 27 Ahaziah is slaine at Gur, and buried at Ierusalem. 30 Proud Iezebel is throwen downe out of a window, and eaten by dogs.
\v 1 ¶ And Elisha the Prophet called one of the children of the Prophets, and said vnto him, Gird vp thy loines, and take this boxe of oile in thine hand, and goe to Ramoth Gilead.
\v 2 And when thou commest thither, looke out there Iehu the sonne of Iehoshaphat, the sonne of Nimshi, and goe in, and make him arise vp from among his brethren, and carie him to an \f + \fr 9:2 \ft Heb. chamber in a chamber.\f*inner chamber.
\v 3 Then \x + \xo 9:3 \xt 1.King. 19.16.\x*take the boxe of oile, and powre \add it\add* on his head, and say, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, I haue anointed thee king ouer Israel: then open the doore, and flee, and tary not.
\v 4 ¶ So the yong man, \add euen\add* the yong man the Prophet, went to Ramoth Gilead:
\v 5 And when hee came, behold, the captaines of the host \add were\add* sitting; and hee said, I haue an errand to thee, O captaine: And Iehu said, Unto which of all vs? And he said, To thee, O captaine.
\v 6 And hee arose, and went into the house, and hee powred the oyle on his head, and said vnto him, Thus sayth the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, I haue anoynted thee king ouer the people of the \nd LORD\nd*, \add euen\add* ouer Israel.
\v 7 And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may auenge the blood of my seruants the Prophets, and the blood of all the seruants of the \nd LORD\nd*, \x + \xo 9:7 \xt 1.Kings 21.15.\x*at the hand of Iezebel.
\v 8 For the whole house of Ahab shal perish, and \x + \xo 9:8 \xt 1.Kings 14.10. and 21.21.\x*I will cut off from Ahab, him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut vp and left in Israel.
\v 9 And I will make the house of Ahab, like the house of \x + \xo 9:9 \xt 1.Kings 14.10. and 21.22.\x*Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, and like the house of \x + \xo 9:9 \xt 1.Kings 16.3.\x*Baasha the sonne of Ahiiah.
\v 10 And the dogges shal eate Iezebel in the portion of Iezreel, and there shal be none to burie \add her\add*. And he opened the doore, and fled.
\v 11 ¶ Then Iehu came foorth to the seruants of his lord, and \add one\add* said vnto him, \add Is\add* all well? wherefore came this madde \add fellow\add* to thee? And he said vnto them, Yee know the man, and his communication.
\v 12 And they said, \add It is\add* false, tell vs now: And hee sayde, Thus and thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, I haue anoynted thee King ouer Israel.
\v 13 Then they hasted, and tooke euery man his garment, and put \add it\add* vnder him on the top of the staires, and blewe with trumpets, saying, Iehu \f + \fr 9:13 \ft Heb. reigneth.\f*is king.
\v 14 So Iehu the sonne of Iehoshaphat, the sonne of Nimshi, conspired against Ioram: (now Ioram had kept Ramoth Gilead, hee, and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria:
\v 15 But \x + \xo 9:15 \xt Cha. 8.29.\x*king \f + \fr 9:15 \ft Heb. Iehoram.\f*Ioram was returned to bee healed in Iezreel, of the wounds which the Syrians had \f + \fr 9:15 \ft Heb. smote\f*giuen him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.) And Iehu said, If it be your minds, \add then\add* \f + \fr 9:15 \ft Heb. let no escaper goe, &c.\f*let none goe forth \add nor\add* escape out of the citie, to goe to tell \add it\add* in Iezreel.
\v 16 So Iehu rode in a charet, and went to Iezreel, (for Ioram lay there:) and Ahaziah king of Iudah was come downe to see Ioram.
\v 17 And there stood a watchman on the towre in Iezreel, and hee spied the company of Iehu as he came, and said, I see a companie. And Ioram sayd, Take an horseman, and send to meete them, and let him say, \add Is it\add* peace?
\v 18 So there went one on horsebacke to meete him, and said, Thus sayth the king, \add Is it\add* peace? And Iehu said, What hast thou to doe with peace? turne thee behinde me. And the watchman tolde, saying, The messenger came to them, but he commeth not againe.
\v 19 Then he sent out a second on horsebacke, which came to them, and sayd, Thus sayth the king, \add Is it\add* peace? And Iehu answered, What hast thou to doe with peace? turne thee behinde me.
\v 20 And the watchman tolde, saying, He came euen vnto them, and commeth not againe: and the \f + \fr 9:20 \ft Or, marching.\f*driuing \add is\add* like the driuing of Iehu the sonne of Nimshi; for he driueth \f + \fr 9:20 \ft Heb. in madnesse.\f*furiously.
\v 21 And Ioram said, \f + \fr 9:21 \ft Heb. bind.\f*Make readie. And his charet was made ready. And Ioram king of Israel, and Ahaziah king of Iudah, went out, each in his charet, and they went out against Iehu, and \f + \fr 9:21 \ft Heb. found\f*met him in the portion of Naboth the Iezreelite.
\v 22 And it came to passe when Ioram saw Iehu, that hee said, \add Is it\add* peace, Iehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredomes of thy mother Iezebel, and her witchcrafts \add are so\add* many?
\v 23 And Ioram turned his hand, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, \add There is\add* treachery, O Ahaziah.
\v 24 And Iehu \f + \fr 9:24 \ft Heb. filled his hand with a bow.\f*drew a bowe with his full strength, and smote Iehoram betweene his armes, and the arrow went out at his heart, and hee \f + \fr 9:24 \ft Heb. bowed.\f*sunke downe in his charet.
\v 25 Then said Iehu to Bidkar his captaine, Take vp, \add and\add* cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Iezreelite: for remember, how that when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the \nd LORD\nd* laide this burden vpon him:
\v 26 \x + \xo 9:26 \xt 1.Kings 21.29.\x*Surely I haue seene yesterday the \f + \fr 9:26 \ft Heb. bloods\f*blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sonnes, sayd the \nd LORD\nd*, and I will requite thee in this \f + \fr 9:26 \ft Or, portion.\f*plat, sayth the \nd LORD\nd*. Now therefore take \add and\add* cast him into the plat \add of ground\add*, according to the word of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 27 ¶ But when Ahaziah the king of Iudah saw this, hee fled by the way of the garden house: and Iehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the charet; and they did so, at the going vp to Gur, which is by Ibleam: And hee fled to Megiddo, and died there.
\v 28 And his seruants caried him in a charet to Ierusalem, and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers, in the citie of Dauid.
\v 29 And in the eleuenth yeere of Ioram the sonne of Ahab, began Ahaziah to reigne ouer Iudah.
\v 30 ¶ And when Iehu was come to Iezreel, Iezebel heard \add of it\add*, and shee \f + \fr 9:30 \ft Heb. put her eyes in painting.\f*painted her face, and tyred her head, and looked out at a window.
\v 31 And as Iehu entred in at the gate, she said, \add Had\add* Zimri peace, who slew his master?
\v 32 And he lift vp his face to the window, and said, Who \add is\add* on my side, who? And there looked out to him two \add or\add* three \f + \fr 9:32 \ft Or.chamberlaines.\f*Eunuches.
\v 33 And he said, Throw her downe. So they threw her downe, and \add some\add* of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her vnder foote.
\v 34 And when he was come in, hee did eate and drinke, and saide, Goe, see now this cursed \add woman\add*, and burie her: for she \add is\add* a kings daughter.
\v 35 And they went to burie her, but they found no more of her then the skul, and the feete, & the palmes of \add her\add* hands.
\v 36 Wherefore they came againe, and told him: and he said, Th\add is\add* is the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, which he spake \f + \fr 9:36 \ft Heb. by the hand of.\f*by his seruant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, \x + \xo 9:36 \xt 1.King. 21.23.\x*In the portion of Iezreel shall dogs eate the flesh of Iezebel:
\v 37 And the carkeise of Iezebel shall be as doung vpon the face of the field in the portion of Iezreel, \add so\add* that they shall not say, This \add is\add* Iezebel.

\iex 1 Iehu by his letters causeth seuentie of Ahabs children to be beheaded. 8 He excuseth the facte by the prophecie of Elijah. 12 At the shearing house he slayeth two and fourtie of Ahaziahs brethren. 15 Hee taketh Iehonadab into his company. 18 By subtiltie hee destroyeth all the worshippers of Baal 29 Iehu followeth Ieroboams sinnes. 32 Hazael oppresseth Israel. 34 Iehoahaz succeedeth Iehu.
\v 1 ¶ And Ahab had seuentie sonnes in Samaria: and Iehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria vnto the rulers of Iezreel, to the Elders, and to \f + \fr 10:1 \ft Heb. nourishers\f*them that brought vp Ahabs \add children\add*, saying,
\v 2 Now assoone as this letter commeth to you, seeing your masters sons \add are\add* with you, and \add there are\add* with you charets and horses, a fenced citie also, and armour:
\v 3 Looke euen out the best and meetest of your masters sonnes, and set \add him\add* on his fathers throne, and fight for your masters house.
\v 4 But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?
\v 5 And he that \add was\add* ouer the house, and he that \add was\add* ouer the citie, the elders also, and the bringers vp \add of the children\add*, sent to Iehu, saying, Wee \add are\add* thy seruants, and will doe all that thou shalt bid vs, we will not make any king: doe thou \add that which is\add* good in thine eyes.
\v 6 Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If yee \add be\add* \f + \fr 10:6 \ft Heb. for me.\f*mine, and \add if\add* ye will hearken vnto my voyce, take ye the heads of the men your masters sonnes, and come to me to Iezreel by to morow this time: (now the kings sonnes \add being\add* seuenty persons, \add were\add* with the great men of the city, which brought them vp.)
\v 7 And it came to passe when the letter came to them, that they tooke the kings sonnes, and slewe seuentie persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him \add them\add* to Iezreel.
\v 8 ¶ And there came a messenger, and tolde him, saying, They haue brought the heads of the kings sonnes. And he said, Lay ye them in two heaps at the entring in of the gate, vntill the morning.
\v 9 And it came to passe in the morning, that he went out, & stood, and said to all the people, Ye \add be\add* righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: But who slew all these?
\v 10 Know now, that there shall fall vnto the earth nothing of the worde of the \nd LORD\nd*, which the \nd LORD\nd* spake concerning the house of Ahab: for the \nd LORD\nd* hath done \add that\add* which he spake \x + \xo 10:10 \xt 1.King. 21.29.\x*\f + \fr 10:10 \ft Heb. by the hand of.\f*by his seruant Elijah.
\v 11 So Iehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab, in Iezreel, and all his great men, and his \f + \fr 10:11 \ft Or, acquaintance.\f*kinsefolkes, and his priests, vntill he left him none remaining.
\v 12 ¶ And hee arose, and departed, and came to Samaria: \add And\add* as he \add was\add* at the \f + \fr 10:12 \ft Heb. house of shepherds binding sheepe.\f*shearing house in the way,
\v 13 Iehu \f + \fr 10:13 \ft Heb. found\f*met with the brethren of Ahaziah king of Iudah, and said, Who \add are\add* ye? And they answered, Wee \add are\add* the brethren of Ahaziah, and we go downe \f + \fr 10:13 \ft Hebr. to the peace of &c.\f*to salute the children of the King, and the children of the Queene.
\v 14 And hee said, Take them aliue. And they tooke them aliue, and slew them at the pit of the shearing house, \add euen\add* two and fourty men; neither left he any of them.
\v 15 ¶ And when hee was departed thence, he \f + \fr 10:15 \ft Hebr. found.\f*lighted on Iehonadab the sonne of Rechab, comming to meet him: and he \f + \fr 10:15 \ft Hebr. blessed.\f*saluted him, & said to him, Is thine heart right, as my heart is with thy heart? And Iehonadab answered, It is: If it be, giue mee thine hand. And hee gaue him his hand, and hee tooke him vp to him into the charet.
\v 16 And he said, Come with me, and see my zeale for the \nd LORD\nd*: so they made him ride in his charet.
\v 17 And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained vnto Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the \nd LORD\nd*, which he spake to Eliiah.
\v 18 ¶ And Iehu gathered all the people together, and said vnto them, Ahab serued Baal a litle, \add but\add* Iehu shall serue him much.
\v 19 Now therefore, call vnto me all the prophets of Baal, all his seruants, and all his priests, let none be wanting: for I haue a great sacrifice to doe to Baal; whosoeuer shall be wanting, he shall not liue. But Iehu did \add it\add* in subtilitie, to the intent that hee might destroy the worshippers of Baal.
\v 20 And Iehu said, \f + \fr 10:20 \ft Hebr. sanctifie.\f*Proclaime a solemne assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed \add it\add*.
\v 21 And Iehu sent through all Israel, and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not: and they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was \f + \fr 10:21 \ft Or, so full, that they stood mouth to mouth.\f*full from one end to another.
\v 22 And he said vnto him that \add was\add* ouer the vestrie, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.
\v 23 And Iehu went, and Iehonadab the sonne of Rechab into the house of Baal, and said vnto the worshippers of Baal, Search, and looke that there be here with you none of the seruants of the \nd LORD\nd*, but the worshippers of Baal onely.
\v 24 And when they went in to offer sacrifices, and burnt offerings, Iehu appointed fourescore men without, and said, \add If\add* any of the men whom I haue brought into your hands, escape, hee that letteth him goe, his life \add shall be\add* for the life of him.
\v 25 And it came to passe assoone as hee had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Iehu saide to the guard, and to the captaines, Goe in, \add and\add* slay \add them\add*, let none come foorth. And they smote them with the \f + \fr 10:25 \ft Hebr. the mouth.\f*edge of the sword, and the guard, and the captaines cast them out, and went to the citie of the house of Baal.
\v 26 And they brought foorth the \f + \fr 10:26 \ft Hebr. statues.\f*Images out of the house of Baal, and burnt them.
\v 27 And they brake downe the image of Baal, and brake downe the house of Baal, and made it a draughthouse, vnto this day.
\v 28 Thus Iehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.
\v 29 ¶ Howbeit, \add from\add* the sinnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, who made Israel to sinne, Iehu departed not from after them, \add to wit\add*, the golden calues that \add were\add* in Bethel, and that \add were\add* in Dan.
\v 30 And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Iehu, Because thou hast done well in executing \add that which is\add* right in mine eyes, \add and\add* hast done vnto the house of Ahab according to all that \add was\add* in mine heart, thy children of the fourth \add generation\add*, shal sit on the throne of Israel.
\v 31 But Iehu \f + \fr 10:31 \ft Hebr. obserued not.\f*tooke no heede to walke in the Law of the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, with all his heart: for he departed not from the sinnes of Ieroboam, which made Israel to sinne.
\v 32 ¶ In those dayes the \nd LORD\nd* began \f + \fr 10:32 \ft Hebr. to cut off the ends.\f*to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel:
\v 33 From Iordan \f + \fr 10:33 \ft Hebr. toward the rising of the Sunne.\f*Eastward, all the land of Gilead, the Gadites, and the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer, (which \add is\add* by the riuer Arnon) \f + \fr 10:33 \ft Or, euen to Gilead and Bashan.\f*euen Gilead and Bashan.
\v 34 Now the rest of the acts of Iehu, and all that he did, & all his might, \add are\add* they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\v 35 And Iehu slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria, and Iehoahaz his sonne reigned in his stead.

\iex 1 Iehoash, being saued by Iehosheba his aunt from Athaliahs massacre of the seed royall, is hid sixe yeeres in the house of God. 4 Iehoiada giuing order to the captaines, in the seuenth yeere anointeth him King. 13 Athaliah is slaine. 17 Iehoiada restoreth the worship of God.
\v 1 ¶ And when \x + \xo 11:1 \xt 2.Chron. 22.10.\x*Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah sawe that her sonne was dead, she arose, and destroyed all the \f + \fr 11:1 \ft Heb. seede of the kingdome.\f*seed royall.
\v 2 But Iehosheba the daughter of king Ioram, sister of Ahaziah, tooke Ioash the sonne of Ahaziah, and stale him from among the Kings sonnes \add which were\add* slaine; and they hid him, \add euen\add* him and his nurse in the bed-chamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slaine.
\v 3 And he was with her hidde in the House of the \nd LORD\nd*, sixe yeeres: and Athaliah did reigne ouer the land.
\v 4 ¶ And \x + \xo 11:4 \xt 2.Chron. 23.1.\x*the seuenth yeere Iehoiada sent and fet the rulers ouer hundreds, with the captains, and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and made a couenant with them, and tooke an othe of them in the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and shewed them the Kings sonne.
\v 5 And he commanded them, saying, This \add is\add* the thing that yee shall doe; A third part of you that enter in on the Sabbath, shall euen be keepers of the watch of the kings house:
\v 6 And a third part \add shall be\add* at the gate of Sur, and a third part at the gate behinde the guard: so shall yee keepe the watch of the house, \f + \fr 11:6 \ft Or, from breaking vp.\f*that it be not broken downe.

\v 8 And yee shall compasse the King round about, euery man with his weapons in his hand: and he that commeth within the ranges, let him bee slaine: and be yee with the king, as hee goeth out, and as he commeth in.
\v 9 And the captaines ouer the hundreds did according to all \add things\add* that Iehoiada the Priest commanded: and they tooke euery man his men that were to come in on the Sabbath, with them that should goe out on the Sabbath, and came to Iehoiada the Priest.
\v 10 And to the captaines ouer hundreds, did the Priest giue king Dauids speares and shields, that \add were\add* in the Temple.
\v 11 And the guard stood, euery man with his weapons in his hand, round about the king, from the right \f + \fr 11:11 \ft Heb. shoulder.\f*corner of the Temple, to the left corner of the Temple, \add along\add* by the Altar and the Temple.

\v 14 And when shee looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the maner \add was\add*, and the Princes, and the trumpetters by the King, and all the people of the land reioyced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah rent her clothes, and cryed, Treason, treason.
\v 15 But Iehoiada the Priest commanded the captaines of the hundreds, the officers of the hoste, and sayde vnto them, Haue her foorth without the ranges; and him that followeth her, kill with the sword: for the Priest had sayd, Let her not be slaine in the house of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 16 And they laid hands on her, and she went by the way, by the which the horses came into the kings house, and there was she slaine.

\v 18 And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and brake it down, his altars, and his images brake they in pieces throughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars: and the Priest appointed \f + \fr 11:18 \ft Heb. offices\f*officers ouer the house of the \nd LORD\nd*.

\v 1 ¶ In \x + \xo 12:1 \xt 2.Chron. 24.1.\x*the seuenth yeere of Iehu, Iehoash began to reigne, and fourtie yeeres reigned he in Ierusalem, and his mothers name \add was\add* Zibiah of Beersheba.
\v 2 And Iehoash did \add that which was\add* right in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd* all his dayes, wherein Iehoiada the Priest instructed him.
\v 3 But the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed, and burnt incense in the high places.
\v 4 ¶ And Iehoash said to the priests, All the money of the \f + \fr 12:4 \ft Or, holy things.

\v 6 But it was so that \f + \fr 12:6 \ft Heb. in the twentieth yeere, and third yeere.\f*in the three and twentieth yeere of king Iehoash, the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.
\v 7 Then king Iehoash called for Iehoiada the priest, and the \add other\add* priests, and saide vnto them, Why repaire ye not the breaches of the house? now therefore receiue no \add more\add* money of your acquaintance, but deliuer it for the breaches of the house.
\v 8 And the priests consented to receiue no \add more\add* money of the people, neither to repaire the breaches of the house.
\v 9 But Iehoiada the priest tooke a chest, and bored a hole in the lid of it, and set it beside the Altar, on the right side, as one commeth into the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and the priests that kept the \f + \fr 12:9 \ft Heb. threshold.\f*doore, put therein all the money \add that was\add* brought into the house of the \nd LORD\nd*.

\v 7 Neither did he leaue of the people to Iehoahaz, but fiftie horsemen, and tenne charets, and tenne thousand footmen: for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like the dust by threshing.
\v 8 ¶ Nowe the rest of the actes of Iehoahaz, and all that he did, and his might, \add are\add* they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\v 9 And Iehoahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria, and Ioash his sonne reigned in his stead.
\v 10 ¶ In the thirty and seuenth yeere of Ioash king of Iudah, beganne Iehoash the sonne of Iehoahaz to reigne ouer Israel in Samaria, \add and reigned\add* sixteene yeeres.
\v 11 And hee did \add that which was\add* euill in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*; hee departed not from all the sinnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, who made Israel sinne: \add but\add* hee walked therein.
\v 12 And the rest of the actes of Ioash, and all that hee did, and his might, wherewith hee fought against Amaziah king of Iudah, \add are\add* they not written in the booke of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\v 13 And Ioash slept with his fathers, and Ieroboam sate vpon his throne: and Ioash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
\v 14 ¶ Nowe Elisha was fallen sicke, of his sicknesse whereof he died, and Ioash the king of Israel came downe vnto him, and wept ouer his face, and said, O my father, my father, the charet of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.
\v 15 And Elisha said vnto him, Take bowe and arrowes. And he tooke vnto him bowe and arrowes.
\v 16 And he said to the king of Israel, \f + \fr 13:16 \ft Heb. make thine hand to ride.\f*Put thine hand vpon the bowe. And he put his hand vpon it: and Elisha put his hands vpon the kings hands.
\v 17 And he sayd, Open the window Eastward. And hee opened \add it\add*. Then Elisha sayd, Shoote. And he shot. And he said; The arrowe of the \nd LORD\nd*s deliuerance, and the arrowe of deliuerance from Syria: for thou shalt smite the Syrians in Aphek, till thou haue consumed \add them\add*.
\v 18 And he sayd, Take the arrowes. And he tooke \add them\add*. And hee said vnto the king of Israel, Smite vpon the ground. And he smote thrise, and stayed.
\v 19 And the man of God was wroth with him, and saide, Thou shouldest haue smitten fiue or sixe times, then haddest thou smitten Syria till thou haddest consumed \add it\add*: whereas now thou shalt smite Syria \add but\add* thrice.
\v 20 ¶ And Elisha died, and they buried him: And the bands of the Moabites inuaded the land at the comming in of the yeere.
\v 21 And it came to passe as they were burying a man, that behold, they spyed a band \add of men\add*, and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha: and when the man \f + \fr 13:21 \ft Heb. went downe.\f*was let downe, and touched the bones of Elisha, \x + \xo 13:21 \xt Ecclus. 48.14.\x*he reuiued, and stood vp on his feete.
\v 22 ¶ But Hazael king of Syria, oppressed Israel all the dayes of Iehoahaz.
\v 23 And the \nd LORD\nd* was gracious vnto them, and had compassion on them, and had respect vnto them, because of his couenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, and would not destroy them, neither cast hee them from his \f + \fr 13:23 \ft Heb. face.\f*presence as yet.
\v 24 So Hazael the king of Syria dyed, and Benhadad his sonne reigned in his stead.
\v 25 And Iehoash the sonne of Iehoahaz \f + \fr 13:25 \ft Heb. returned and tooke.\f*tooke againe out of the hand of Benhadad the sonne of Hazael, the cities which he had taken out of the hand of Iehoahaz his father, by warre: three times did Ioash beat him, and recouered the cities of Israel.
\c 14
\iex 1 Amaziah his good reigne. 5 His iustice on the murderers of his father. 7 His victory ouer Edom. 8 Amaziah prouoking Iehoash, is ouercome and spoiled. 15 Ieroboam succeedeth Iehoash. 17 Amaziah slaine by a conspiracie. 21 Azariah succeedeth him. 23 Ieroboams wicked reigne. 28 Zachariah succeedeth him.
\v 1 ¶ In the second yeere of Ioash sonne of Iehoahaz king of Israel, reigned \x + \xo 14:1 \xt 2.Chron. 25.1.\x*Amaziah the sonne of Ioash king of Iudah.
\v 2 Hee was twentie and fiue yeeres olde when he began to reigne, and reigned twentie and nine yeeres in Ierusalem: and his mothers name \add was\add* Iehoaddan of Ierusalem.
\v 3 And he did \add that which was\add* right in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, yet not like Dauid his father: hee did according to all things as Ioash his father did.
\v 4 Howbeit, the high places were not taken away: as yet the people did sacrifice, and burnt incense on the high places.
\v 5 ¶ And it came to passe assoone as the kingdome was confirmed in his hand, that he slew his seruants \x + \xo 14:5 \xt Chap. 12.20.\x*which had slaine the king his father.
\v 6 But the children of the murderers he slew not, according vnto that which is written in the booke of the Law of Moses, wherein the \nd LORD\nd* commanded, saying, \x + \xo 14:6 \xt Deut. 24.16. ezek. 18.20.\x*The fathers shal not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers: but euery man shall be put to death for his owne sinne.
\v 7 He slew of Edom in the valley of salt, ten thousand, and tooke \f + \fr 14:7 \ft Or, the rocke.\f*Selah by warre, and called the name of it, Ioktheel, vnto this day.
\v 8 ¶ Then Amaziah sent messengers to Iehoash the sonne of Iehoahaz sonne of Iehu king of Israel, saying, Come, let vs looke one another in the face.
\v 9 And Iehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Iudah, saying, The thistle that \add was\add* in Lebanon, sent to the Cedar that \add was\add* in Lebanon, saying, Giue thy daughter to my sonne to wife. And there passed by a wilde beast that \add was\add* in Lebanon, and trode downe the thistle.
\v 10 Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted thee vp: glory \add of this\add*, and tary \f + \fr 14:10 \ft Heb. at thy house.\f*at home: for why shouldest thou meddle to \add thy\add* hurt, that thou shouldest fall, \add euen\add* thou, and Iudah with thee?
\v 11 But Amaziah would not heare: therefore Iehoash king of Israel went vp, and hee, and Amaziah king of Iudah, looked one another in the face at Bethshemesh, which \add belongeth\add* to Iudah.
\v 12 And Iudah \f + \fr 14:12 \ft Heb. was smitten.\f*was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled euery man to their tents.
\v 13 And Iehoash king of Israel tooke Amaziah king of Iudah, the sonne of Iehoash the sonne of Ahaziah at Bethshemesh, and came to Ierusalem, and brake downe the wall of Ierusalem, from the gate of Ephraim, vnto the corner gate, foure hundred cubites.
\v 14 And he tooke all the golde and siluer, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and in the treasures of the kings house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.
\v 15 ¶ Now the rest of the acts of Iehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Iudah, \add are\add* they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\v 16 And Iehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria, with the kings of Israel, and Ieroboam his sonne reigned in his stead.
\v 17 ¶ And Amaziah the sonne of Ioash king of Iudah, liued after the death of Iehoash sonne of Iehoahaz king of Israel, fifteene yeeres.
\v 18 And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, \add are\add* they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Iudah?
\v 19 Now \x + \xo 14:19 \xt 2.Chron. 15.27.\x*they made a conspiracie against him in Ierusalem: and he fled to Lachish, but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there.
\v 20 And they brought him on horses, and he was buried at Ierusalem with his fathers, in the city of Dauid.
\v 21 ¶ And all the people of Iudah tooke \x + \xo 14:19 \xt 2.Chron. 15.27.\x*Azariah (which \add was\add* sixteene yeeres old) and made him king in stead of his father Amaziah.
\v 22 He built Elath, and restored it to Iudah, after that the king slept with his fathers.
\v 23 ¶ In the fifteenth yeere of Amaziah the sonne of Ioash king of Iudah, Ieroboam the sonne of Ioash king of Israel began to raigne in Samaria, and raigned forty and one yeeres:
\v 24 And hee did \add that which was\add* euill in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*: hee departed not from all the sinnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, who made Israel to sinne.
\v 25 Hee restored the coast of Israel, from the entring of Hamath, vnto the sea of the plaine, according to the word of the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, which he spake by the hand of his seruant \x + \xo 14:25 \xt Matth. 12.39,40. called Ionas.\x*Ionah, the sonne of Amittai the Prophet, which \add was\add* of Gath Hepher.
\v 26 For the \nd LORD\nd* saw the affliction of Israel, \add that it was\add* very bitter: for \add there was\add* not any shut vp, nor any left, nor any helper for Israel.
\v 27 And the \nd LORD\nd* said not, that hee would blot out the name of Israel from vnder heauen: but he saued them by the hand of Ieroboam the sonne of Ioash.
\v 28 ¶ Now the rest of the actes of Ieroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recouered Damascus and Hamath, \add which belonged\add* to Iudah, for Israel, are they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\v 29 And Ieroboam slept with his fathers, \add euen\add* with the kings of Israel, and Zachariah his sonne reigned in his stead.
\c 15
\iex 1 Azariah his good reigne. 5 He dying a Leper, Iotham succeedeth. 8 Zachariah, the last of Iehu his generation, reigning ill, is slaine by Shallum. 13 Shallum reigning a moneth, is slaine by Menahem. 16 Menahem strengtheneth himselfe by Pul. 21 Pekahiah succeedeth him. 23 Pekahiah is slaine by Pekah. 27 Pekah is oppressed by Tiglath Pileser, and slaine by Hoshea. 32 Iothams good reigne. 36 Ahaz succeedeth him.
\v 1 ¶ In the twenty and seuenth yeere of Ieroboam king of Israel, began Azariah sonne of Amaziah king of Iudah to reigne.
\v 2 Sixteene yeeres old was he when he began to reigne, and he reigned two aud fifty yeeres in Ierusalem: and his mothers name \add was\add* Iecholiah of Ierusalem.
\v 3 And he did \add that which was\add* right in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, according to all that his father Amaziah had done;
\v 4 Saue that the high places were not remoued: the people sacrificed, and burnt incense still on the high places.
\v 5 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* smote the king, so that hee was a Leper vnto the day of his death, and dwelt in a seuerall house, and Iotham the kings sonne \add was\add* ouer the house, iudging the people of the land.
\v 6 And the rest of the actes of Azariah, and all that hee did, \add are\add* they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Iudah?
\v 7 So Azariah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the city of Dauid, and Iotham his sonne reigned in his stead.
\v 8 ¶ In the thirty and eight yeere of Azariah king of Iudah, did Zachariah the sonne of Ieroboam reigne ouer Israel in Samaria sixe moneths.
\v 9 And hee did \add that which was\add* euil in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, as his fathers had done: he departed not from the sinnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, who made Israel to sinne.
\v 10 And Shallum the sonne of Iabesh, conspired against him, and smote him before the people, and slewe him, and reigned in his stead.
\v 11 And the rest of the actes of Zachariah, beholde, they \add are\add* written in the booke of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
\v 12 This \add was\add* \x + \xo 15:12 \xt Chap. 10.30.\x*the word of the \nd LORD\nd* which he spake vnto Iehu, saying, Thy sonnes shall sit on the throne of Israel, vnto the fourth \add generation\add*. And so it came to passe.
\v 13 ¶ Shallum the sonne of Iabesh began to reigne in the nine and thirtieth yeere of \x + \xo 15:13 \xt Matth. 1.9. called Ozias.\x*Uzziah king of Iudah, and he reigned \f + \fr 15:13 \ft Hebr. a moneth of dayes.\f*a full moneth in Samaria.
\v 14 For Menahem the sonne of Gadi, went vp from Tirzah, and came to Samaria, and smote Shallum the sonne of Iabesh, in Samaria, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.
\v 15 And the rest of the actes of Shallum, and the conspiracy which he made, behold, they \add are\add* written in the booke of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
\v 16 ¶ Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that \add were\add* therein, and the coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not \add to him\add*, therfore he smote it, and all the women therein that were with child, he ript vp.
\v 17 In the nine and thirtieth yeere of Azariah king of Iudah, began Menahem the sonne of Gadi to reigne ouer Israel, \add and reigned\add* tenne yeres in Samaria.
\v 18 And he did \add that which was\add* euill in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*: hee departed not all his dayes from the sinnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, who made Israel to sinne.
\v 19 \x + \xo 15:19 \xt 1.Chron. 5.26.\x*\add And\add* Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem gaue Pul a thousand talents of siluer, that his hand might be with him, to confirm the kingdome in his hand.
\v 20 And Menahem \f + \fr 15:20 \ft Heb. caused to come forth.\f*exacted the mony of Israel, \add euen\add* of all the mightie men of wealth, of each man fiftie shekels of siluer, to giue to the king of Assyria: so the king of Assyria turned backe, and stayed not there in the land.
\v 21 ¶ And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, \add are\add* they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel?
\v 22 And Menahem slept with his fathers, and Pekahiah his sonne reigned in his stead.
\v 23 ¶ In the fiftieth yere of Azariah king of Iudah, Pekahiah the sonne of Menahem began to reigne ouer Israel in Samaria, \add and reigned\add* two yeeres.
\v 24 And he did \add that which was\add* euill in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, hee departed not from the sinnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, who made Israel to sinne.
\v 25 But Pekah the sonne of Remaliah, a captaine of his, conspired against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the kings house, with Argob, and Arieh, and with him fiftie men of the Gileadites: and hee killed him, and reigned in his roume.
\v 26 And the rest of the actes of Pekahiah, and all that he did, beholde, they \add are\add* written in the booke of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
\v 27 ¶ In the two and fiftieth yeere of Azariah king of Iudah, Pekah the sonne of Remaliah began to reigne ouer Israel in Samaria, \add and reigned\add* twentie yeeres.
\v 28 And he did \add that which was\add* euill in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, hee departed not from the sinnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, who made Israel to sinne.
\v 29 In the dayes of Pekah king of Israel, came Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria, and tooke Iion, and Abel-Beth-maachah, and Ianoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and caried them captiue to Assyria.
\v 30 And Hoshea the sonne of Elah, made a conspiracie against Pekah the sonne of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth yeere of Iotham the sonne of Uzziah.
\v 31 And the rest of the actes of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they \add are\add* written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel.
\v 32 ¶ \x + \xo 15:32 \xt 2.Chron. 27.1.\x*In the second yeere of Pekah the sonne of Remaliah king of Israel, began Iotham the sonne of Uzziah king of Iudah to reigne.
\v 33 Fiue and twentie yeeres olde was he when he began to reigne, and hee reigned sixteene yeeres in Ierusalem: and his mothers name \add was\add* Ierusha, the daughter of Zadok.
\v 34 And he did \add that which was\add* right in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*: hee did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.
\v 35 ¶ Howbeit, the high places were not remoued: the people sacrificed and burnt incense still in the high places: He built the higher gate of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 36 ¶ Now the rest of the actes of Iotham, and all that hee did, \add are\add* they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Iudah?
\v 37 (In those dayes the \nd LORD\nd* began to send against Iudah, Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the sonne of Remaliah)
\v 38 And Iotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the citie of Dauid his father, and Ahaz his sonne reigned in his stead.
\c 16
\iex 1 Ahaz his wicked reigne. 5 Ahaz assailed by Rezin and Pekah, hireth Tiglath Pileser against them. 10 Ahaz sending a paterne of an Altar from Damascus to Urijah, diuerteth the brasen Altar to his owne deuotion. 17 Hee spoileth the Temple. 19 Hezekiah succeedeth him.
\v 1 ¶ In \x + \xo 16:1 \xt 2.Chron. 28.1.\x*the seuenteenth yeere of Pekah the sonne of Remaliah, Ahaz the sonne of Iotham King of Iudah began to reigne.
\v 2 Twentie yeeres olde \add was\add* Ahaz when hee began to reigne, and reigned sixteene yeeres in Ierusalem, and did not \add that which was\add* right in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd* his God, like Dauid his father:
\v 3 But hee walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea & made his sonne to passe through the fire, according to the abominations of the heathen, whom the \nd LORD\nd* cast out from before the children of Israel.
\v 4 And hee sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hils, and vnder euery greene tree.
\v 5 ¶ \x + \xo 16:5 \xt Isa 7.1.\x*Then Rezin king of Syria, and Pekah sonne of Remaliah king of Israel, came vp to Ierusalem to warre: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not ouercome \add him\add*.
\v 6 At that time Rezin king of Syria, recouered Elath to Syria, & draue the Iewes from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt there vnto this day.
\v 7 So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria, saying, I \add am\add* thy seruant, and thy sonne: come vp, and saue me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, which rise vp against me.
\v 8 And Ahaz tooke the siluer and gold that was found in the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and in the treasures of the kings house, and sent \add it for\add* a present to the king of Assyria.
\v 9 And the king of Assyria hearkened vnto him: for the king of Assyria went vp against Damascus, and tooke it, and caried \add the people of\add* it captiue to Kir, and slew Rezin.
\v 10 ¶ And King Ahaz went to \f + \fr 16:10 \ft Heb. Dammesek.\f*Damascus, to meete Tiglath Pileser king of Assyria, and saw an altar that \add was\add* at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to Uriiah the Priest the fashion of the altar, and the paterne of it, according to all the workemanship thereof.
\v 11 And Uriiah the Priest built an altar: according to all that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus, so Uriiah the Priest made \add it\add*, against king Ahaz came from Damascus.
\v 12 And when the king was come from Damascus, the King saw the altar: and the King approched to the altar, and offered thereon.
\v 13 And he burnt his burnt offering, and his meate offering, and powred his drinke offering, and sprinkled the blood of \f + \fr 16:13 \ft Heb. which were his.\f*his peace offerings vpon the altar.
\v 14 And hee brought also the brasen altar which \add was\add* before the \nd LORD\nd*, from the forefront of the house, from betweene the altar and the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and put it on the North side of the altar.
\v 15 And king Ahaz commanded Uriiah the Priest, saying, Upon the great altar, burne the morning burnt offering, and the euening meate offering, and the Kings burnt sacrifice, and his meate offering, with the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meate offering, and their drinke offerings, and sprinkle vpon it all the blood of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and the brasen altar shall be for me to enquire \add by\add*.
\v 16 Thus did Uriiah the Priest, according to all that king Ahaz commaunded.
\v 17 ¶ And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and remooued the lauer from off them, and tooke downe the sea from off the brasen oxen that \add were\add* vnder it, and put it vpon a pauement of stones:
\v 18 And the couert for the Sabbath that they had built in the house, and the kings entry without, turned hee from the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, for the king of Assyria.
\v 19 ¶ Now the rest of the actes of Ahaz, which he did, \add are\add* they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Iudah?
\v 20 And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of Dauid, and Hezekiah his sonne reigned in his stead.
\c 17
\iex 1 Hoshea his wicked reigne. 3 Being subdued by Shalmaneser, hee conspireth against him with So King of Egypt. 5 Samaria for their sinnes, is captiuated. 24 The strange nations, which were transplanted in Samaria, beeing plagued with Lions, make a mixture of Religions.
\v 1 ¶ In the twelfth yeere of Ahaz, king of Iudah, began Hoshea the sonne of Elah to reigne in Samaria, ouer Israel nine yeeres.
\v 2 And hee did \add that which was\add* euill in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, but not as the kings of Israel that were before him.
\v 3 ¶ Against him came vp Shalmaneser king of Assyria, and Hoshea became his seruant, and \f + \fr 17:3 \ft Hebr. rendred.\f*gaue him \f + \fr 17:3 \ft Or, tribute.\f*presents.
\v 4 An the king of Assyria found conspiracie in Hoshea: for hee had sent messengers to So king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as \add he had done\add* yeere by yeere: therefore the king of Assyria shut him vp, and bound him in prison.
\v 5 ¶ Then the king of Assyria came vp thorowout all the land, and went vp to Samaria, and besieged it three yeres.
\v 6 ¶ \x + \xo 17:6 \xt Chap. 18.10.\x*In the ninth yeere of Hoshea, the king of Assyria tooke Samaria, and caried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah, and in Habor \add by\add* the riuer of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
\v 7 For \add so\add* it was, that the children of Israel had sinned against the \nd LORD\nd* their God, which had brought them vp out of the land of Egypt, from vnder the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and had feared other gods,
\v 8 And walked in the statutes of the heathen, (whom the \nd LORD\nd* cast out from before the children of Israel) and of the kings of Israel, which they had made.
\v 9 And the children of Israel did secretly \add those\add* things that \add were\add* not right, against the \nd LORD\nd* their God: and they built them high places in all their cities, from the tower of the watchmen, to the fenced city.
\v 10 And they set them vp \f + \fr 17:10 \ft Heb. statues.\f*images, and groues in euery high hill, and vnder euery greene tree.
\v 11 And there they burnt incense in all the high places, as \add did\add* the heathen whom the \nd LORD\nd* caried away before them, and wrought wicked things to prouoke the \nd LORD\nd* to anger.
\v 12 For they serued idoles, whereof the \nd LORD\nd* had said vnto them, \x + \xo 17:12 \xt Deut. 4.19.\x*Yee shall not doe this thing.
\v 13 Yet the \nd LORD\nd* testified against Israel, and against Iudah, \f + \fr 17:13 \ft Heb. by the hand of all.\f*by all the Prophets, \add and by\add* all the Seers, saying, \x + \xo 17:13 \xt Ierem. 18.11. and 25.5. & 35.15.\x*Turne ye from your euill wayes, \add and\add* keepe my commandements, and my statutes, according to all the law which I commanded your fathers, and which I sent to you by my seruants the Prophets.
\v 14 Notwithstanding, they would not heare, but hardened their neckes, like to the necke of their fathers, that did not beleeue in the \nd LORD\nd* their God.
\v 15 And they reiected his Statutes, and his Couenant that hee made with their fathers, and his Testimonies which he testified against them, and they followed vanitie, and became vaine, and went after the heathen that \add were\add* round about them, \add concerning\add* whom the \nd LORD\nd* had charged them, that they should not doe like them.
\v 16 And they left all the Commandements of the \nd LORD\nd* their God, and \x + \xo 17:16 \xt Exod. 32.8. 1.king. 12.28.\x*made them molten images, \add euen\add* two calues, and made a groue, and worshipped all the hoste of heauen, and serued Baal.
\v 17 And they caused their sonnes and their daughters to passe through the fire, and vsed diuination, and inchantments, and sold themselues to doe euill in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, to prouoke him to anger.
\v 18 Therefore the \nd LORD\nd* was very angry with Israel, and remoued them out of his sight, there was none left, but the tribe of Iudah onely.
\v 19 Also Iudah kept not the Commandements of the \nd LORD\nd* their God, but walked in the Statutes of Israel which they made.
\v 20 And the \nd LORD\nd* reiected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and deliuered them into the hand of spoilers, vntill he had cast them out of his sight.
\v 21 For he rent Israel from the house of Dauid, and they made Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat king, and Ieroboam draue Israel from following the \nd LORD\nd*, and made them sinne a great sinne.
\v 22 For the children of Israel walked in al the sinnes of Ieroboam which he did, they departed not from them:
\v 23 Untill the \nd LORD\nd* remoued Israel out of his sight, as hee had said by all his seruants the Prophets: so was Israel caried away out of their owne land to Assyria, vnto this day.
\v 24 ¶ And the King of Assyria brought \add men\add* from Babylon, and from Cuthah, and from Aua, and from Hamath, and from Sepharuaim, and placed \add them\add* in the cities of Samaria, in stead of the children of Israel; and they possessed Samaria, and dwelt in the cities thereof.
\v 25 And \add so\add* it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, \add that\add* they feared not the \nd LORD\nd*; therefore the \nd LORD\nd* sent Lions among them, which slew \add some\add* of them.
\v 26 Wherefore they spake to the king of Assyria, saying, The nations which thou hast remoued, and placed in the cities of Samaria, know not the maner of the God of the land: therfore he hath sent Lions among them, and beholde, they slay them, because they know not the maner of the God of the land.
\v 27 Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carie thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence, and let them goe and dwell there, and let him teach them the maner of the God of the land.
\v 28 Then one of the priests whom they had caried away from Samaria, came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them howe they should feare the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 29 Howbeit, euery nation made gods of their owne, and put \add them\add* in the houses of the high places which the Samaritanes had made, euery nation in their cities wherein they dwelt:
\v 30 And the men of Babylon made Succoth-Benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima:
\v 31 And the Auites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharuites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech, and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharuaim.
\v 32 So they feared the \nd LORD\nd*, and made vnto themselues of the lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.
\v 33 \x + \xo 17:33 \xt Sophan. 1.5.\x*They feared the \nd LORD\nd*, and serued their owne gods, after the maner of the nations \f + \fr 17:33 \ft Or, who caried them away from thence.\f*whom they caried away from thence.
\v 34 Unto this day they doe after the former maners: they feare not the \nd LORD\nd*, neither doe they after their Statutes, or after their Ordinances, or after the Law and Commaundement which the \nd LORD\nd* commaunded the children of Iacob, \x + \xo 17:34 \xt Gen. 32.28. 1.King. 18.31.\x*whom hee named Israel,
\v 35 With whom the \nd LORD\nd* had made a Couenant, and charged them, saying, \x + \xo 17:35 \xt Iudg.6.10.\x*Yee shall not feare other gods, nor bow your selues to them, nor serue them, nor sacrifice to them:
\v 36 But the \nd LORD\nd*, who brought you vp out of the land of Egypt, with great power, and a stretched out arme, him shall ye feare, and him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye doe sacrifice.
\v 37 And the Statutes, and the Ordinances, and the Law, and the Commandement which he wrote for you, ye shall obserue to doe for euermore, and ye shall not feare other gods:
\v 38 And the Couenant that I haue made with you, ye shall no forget, neither shall ye feare other gods.
\v 39 But the \nd LORD\nd* your God yee shall feare, and he shall deliuer you out of the hand of all your enemies.
\v 40 Howbeit, they did not hearken, but they did after their former maner.
\v 41 So these nations feared the \nd LORD\nd*, and serued their grauen images, both their children, and their childrens children: as did their fathers, so doe they vnto this day.

\v 8 ¶ So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah: for hee had heard that he was departed from Lachish.
\v 9 And when he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, Behold, hee is come out to fight against thee: hee sent messengers againe vnto Hezekiah, saying,
\v 10 Thus shall ye speake to Hezekiah king of Iudah, saying, Let not thy God in whome thou trustest, deceiue thee, saying, Ierusalem shall not be deliuered into the hande of the king of Assyria.
\v 11 Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria haue done to all lands, by destroying them vtterly: and shalt thou be deliuered?
\v 12 Haue the gods of the nations deliuered them which my fathers haue destroyed? As Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Thelasar?
