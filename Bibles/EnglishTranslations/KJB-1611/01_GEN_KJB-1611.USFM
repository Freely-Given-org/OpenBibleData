\v 1 ¶ Now the serpent was more subtill then any beast of the field, which the \nd LORD\nd* God had made, and he said vnto the woman, \f + \fr 3:1 \ft Heb. Yea, because, &c.\f*Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of euery tree of the garden?
\v 2 And the woman said vnto the serpent, Wee may eate of the fruite of the trees of the garden:
\v 3 But of the fruit of the tree, which \add is\add* in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shal not eate of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
\v 4 And the Serpent said vnto the woman, Ye shall not \x + \xo 3:4 \xt 2.Cor. 11.3. 1.tim. 2.14.\x*surely die.
\v 5 For God doeth know, that in the day ye eate thereof, then your eyes shalbee opened: and yee shall bee as Gods, knowing good and euill.
\v 6 And the woman saw, that the tree \add was\add* good for food, and that it \add was\add* \f + \fr 3:6 \ft Heb. a desire.\f*pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make \add one\add* wise, she tooke of the fruit thereof, \x + \xo 3:6 \xt Ecclus. 25.26. 1.tim. 2.14.\x*and did eate, and gaue also vnto her husband with her, and hee did eate.

\v 9 And the \nd LORD\nd* God called vnto Adam, and said vnto him, Where \add art\add* thou?
\v 10 And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden: and I was afraid, because I \add was\add* naked, and I hid my selfe.
\v 11 And he said, Who told thee, that thou \add wast\add* naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee, that thou shouldest not eate?
\v 12 And the man said, The woman whom thou gauest \add to be\add* with mee, shee gaue me of the tree, and I did eate.
\v 13 And the \nd LORD\nd* God said vnto the woman, What \add is\add* this \add that\add* thou hast done? And the woman said, The Serpent beguiled me, and I did eate.
\v 14 And the \nd LORD\nd* God said vnto the Serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou \add art\add* cursed aboue all cattel, and aboue euery beast of the field: vpon thy belly shalt thou goe, and dust shalt thou eate, all the dayes of thy life.
\v 15 And I will put enmitie betweene thee and the woman, and betweene thy seed and her seed: it shal bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heele.
\v 16 Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorowe and thy conception. In sorow thou shalt bring forth children: and thy desire \add shall be\add* \f + \fr 3:16 \ft Or, subiect to thy husband.\f*to thy husband, and hee shall \x + \xo 3:16 \xt 1.Corin. 14.34.\x*rule ouer thee.
\v 17 And vnto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened vnto the voyce of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commaunded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eate of it: cursed \add is\add* the ground for thy sake: in sorow shalt thou eate \add of\add* it all the dayes of thy life.
\v 18 Thornes also and thistles shall it \f + \fr 3:18 \ft Heb. cause to bud.\f*bring forth to thee: and thou shalt eate the herbe of the field.
\v 19 In the sweate of thy face shalt thou eate bread, till thou returne vnto the ground: for out of it wast thou taken, for dust thou \add art\add*, and vnto dust shalt thou returne.
\v 20 And Adam called his wiues name \f + \fr 3:20 \ft Heb. Chanah.\f*Eue, because she was the mother of all liuing.
\v 21 Unto Adam also, and to his wife, did the \nd LORD\nd* God make coates of skinnes, and cloathed them.
\v 22 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* God said, Behold, the man is become as one of vs, to know good & euill. And now lest hee put foorth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eate and liue for euer:
\v 23 Therefore the \nd LORD\nd* God sent him foorth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground, from whence he was taken.
\v 24 So he droue out the man: and he placed at the East of the garden of Eden, Cherubims, and a flaming sword, which turned euery way, to keepe the way of the tree of life.

\v 9 ¶ And they said vnto him, Where \add is\add* Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.

\v 11 Now Abraham and Sarah \add were\add* old, \add and\add* well stricken in age: \add and\add* it ceased to be with Sarah after the maner of women.
\v 12 \f + \fr 18:12 \ft 1.Pet.3. 6.\f*Therefore Sarah laughed within her selfe, saying, After I am waxed old, shall I haue pleasure, my \nd LORD\nd* being old also?
\v 13 And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying; Shall I of a surety beare a childe, which am old?
\v 14 Is any thing too hard for the \nd LORD\nd*? At the time appointed will I returne vnto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall haue a sonne.
\v 15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not: for she was afraid. And he said, Nay, but thou diddest laugh.
\v 16 ¶ And the men rose vp from thence, and looked toward Sodome: and Abraham went with them, to bring them on the way.
\v 17 And the \nd LORD\nd* said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I doe;

\v 20 And the \nd LORD\nd* said, Because the cry of Sodome and Gomorrah is great, and because their sinne is very grieuous:
\v 21 I will goe downe now, and see whether they haue done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come vnto me: and if not, I will know.
\v 22 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodome: but Abraham stood yet before the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 23 ¶ And Abraham drew neere, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?
\v 24 Peraduenture there be fifty righteous within the citie; wilt thou also destroy, and not spare the place for the fiftie righteous, that \add are\add* therein?
\v 25 That be farre from thee, to do after this maner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be farre from thee: Shall not the Iudge of all the earth doe right?
\v 26 And the \nd LORD\nd* said, If I find in Sodom fiftie righteous, within the citie, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.
\v 27 And Abraham answered, and said, Behold now, I haue taken vpon me to speake vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, which \add am but\add* dust and ashes.
\v 28 Peraduenture there shall lacke fiue of the fiftie righteous: wilt thou destroy all the citie for lacke of fiue? And he said, If I find there fourtie and fiue, I will not destroy \add it\add*.
\v 29 And hee spake vnto him yet againe, and said, Peraduenture there shall be fourtie found there: and he said, I will not doe \add it\add* for fourties sake.
\v 30 And he said \add vnto him\add*, Oh let not the \nd  LORD\nd* be angry, and I will speake: Peraduenture there shall thirtie bee found there. And he said, I will not doe \add it\add*, if I find thirtie there.
\v 31 And he said, Behold now, I haue taken vpon mee to speake vnto the \nd  LORD\nd*: Peraduenture there shall bee twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy \add it\add* for twenties sake.
\v 32 And hee saide, Oh let not the \nd  LORD\nd* be angry, and I will speake yet but this once: Peraduenture ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy \add it\add* for tennes sake.
\v 33 And the \nd LORD\nd* went his way, assoone as hee had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned vnto his place.

\v 3 And he pressed vpon them greatly, and they turned in vnto him, and entred into his house: and he made them a feast, and did bake vnleauened bread, and they did eate.

\v 6 And Lot went out at the doore vnto them, & shut the doore after him,

\v 8 Behold now, I haue two daughters, which haue not knowen man; let mee, I pray you, bring them out vnto you, and doe ye to them, as \add is\add* good in your eyes: onely vnto these men do nothing: for therefore came they vnder the shadow of my roofe.
\v 9 And they said, Stand backe. And they said againe, This one \add fellow\add* came in to soiourne, and he will needs bee a Iudge: Now wil we deale worse with thee, then with them. And they pressed sore vpon the man, \add euen\add* Lot, and came neere to breake the doore.

\v 14 And Lot went out, and spake vnto his sonnes in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get yee out of this place: for the \nd LORD\nd* wil destroy this citie: but hee seemed as one that mocked, vnto his sonnes in law.

\v 18 And Lot said vnto them, Oh not so, my \nd  LORD\nd*.
\v 19 Beholde now, thy seruant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed vnto me, in sauing my life, and I cannot escape to the mountaine, lest some euill take me, and I die.

\v 28 And he looked toward Sodome and Gomorrah, & toward all the land of the plaine, and beheld, and loe, the smoke of the countrey went vp as the smoke of a furnace.
\v 29 ¶ And it came to passe, when God destroyed the cities of the plaine, that God remembred Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the ouerthrow, when he ouerthrew the cities, in the which Lot dwelt.
\v 30 ¶ And Lot went vp out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountaine, and his two daughters with him: for hee feared to dwell in Zoar, and he dwelt in a caue, he and his two daughters.
\v 31 And the first borne saide vnto the yonger, Our father \add is\add* old, and \add there is\add* not a man in the earth, to come in vnto vs, after the maner of all the earth.

\v 1 ¶ And Abraham iourneyed from thence, toward the South-Countrey, and dwelled betweene Cadesh and Shur, and soiourned in Gerar.
\v 2 And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She \add is\add* my sister: And Abimelech King of Gerar sent, and tooke Sarah.

\v 6 And God saide vnto him in a dreame, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integritie of thy heart: for I also withheld thee from sinning against mee, therefore suffered I thee not to touch her.
\v 7 Now therefore restore the man \add his\add* wife: for he \add is\add* a Prophet, and he shal pray for thee, and thou shalt liue: and if thou restore \add her\add* not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou, and all that \add are\add* thine.
\v 8 Therefore Abimelech rose earely in the morning, and called all his seruants, and told all these things in their eares: and the men were sore afraid.
\v 9 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said vnto him, What hast thou done vnto vs? and what haue I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me, and on my kingdome a great sinne? thou hast done deeds vnto mee that ought not to be done.
\v 10 And Abimelech said vnto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?
\v 11 And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the feare of God \add is\add* not in this place: and they will slay mee for my wiues sake.
\v 12 And yet indeed \add shee is\add* my sister: she \add is\add* the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and shee became my wife.
\v 13 \f + \fr 20:13 \ft Chap.12. 13.\f*And it came to passe when God caused me to wander from my fathers house, that I said vnto her, This \add is\add* thy kindnesse which thou shalt shew vnto me; at euery place whither wee shall come, say of me, He \add is\add* my brother.
\v 14 And Abimelech tooke sheepe and oxen, and men-seruants, and women seruants, and gaue \add them\add* vnto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife.

\v 17 ¶ So Abraham prayed vnto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-seruants, and they bare \add children\add*.

\v 7 And she said, Who would haue said vnto Abraham, that Sarah should haue giuen children sucke? for I haue borne \add him\add* a sonne in his old age.
\v 8 And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast, the \add same\add* day that Isaac was weaned.
\v 9 ¶ And Sarah saw the sonne of Hagar the Egyptian, which shee had borne vnto Abraham, mocking.

\v 11 And the thing was very grieuous in Abrahams sight, because of his sonne.
\v 12 ¶ And God said vnto Abraham, Let it not be grieuous in thy sight, because of the lad, and because of thy bond woman. In all that Sarah hath said vnto thee, hearken vnto her voice: for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
\v 13 And also, of the sonne of the bond woman will I make a nation, because he \add is\add* thy seed.
\v 14 And Abraham rose vp earely in the morning, and tooke bread, and a bottle of water, and gaue \add it\add* vnto Hagar, (putting \add it\add* on her shoulder,) and the child, and sent her away: and shee departed, and wandered in the wildernesse of Beer-sheba.
\v 15 And the water was spent in the bottle, and shee cast the child vnder one of the shrubs.
\v 16 And she went, and sate her downe ouer against \add him\add*, a good way off, as it were a bow shoot: for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And shee sate ouer against \add him\add*, and lift vp her voice, and wept.
\v 17 And God heard the voice of the lad, and the Angel of God called to Hagar out of heauen, and said vnto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? feare not: for God hath heard the voice of the ladde, where he \add is\add*.
\v 18 Arise, lift vp the lad, and hold him in thine hand: for I will make him a great nation.
\v 19 And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water, and shee went, and filled the bottle with water, and gaue the lad drinke.
\v 20 And God was with the lad, and he grew, and dwelt in the wildernesse, and became an archer.
\v 21 And hee dwelt in the wildernesse of Paran: and his mother tooke him a wife out of the land of Egypt.
\v 22 ¶ And it came to passe at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol the chiefe captaine of his hoste spake vnto Abraham, saying, God \add is\add* with thee in all that thou doest.

\v 24 And Abraham saide, I will sweare.
\v 25 And Abraham reproued Abimelech, because of a well of water, which Abimelechs seruants had violently taken away.
\v 26 And Abimelech saide, I wote not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I \add of it\add*, but to day.
\v 27 And Abraham tooke sheepe and oxen, and gaue them vnto Abimelech: and both of them made a couenant.
\v 28 And Abraham set seuen ewe lambes of the flocke by themselues.
\v 29 And Abimelech said vnto Abraham, What meane these seuen ewe lambes, which thou hast set by themselues?

\v 21 And Isaac saide vnto Iacob, Come neere, I pray thee, that I may feele thee, my sonne, whether thou \add bee\add* my very sonne Esau, or not.
\v 22 And Iacob went neere vnto Isaac his father: and hee felt him, and said, The voyce \add is\add* Iacobs voyce, but the hands \add are\add* the hands of Esau.
\v 23 And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairie, as his brother Esaus hands: So he blessed him.

\v 25 And he said, Bring \add it\add* neere to me, and I will eate of my sonnes venison, that my soule may blesse thee: and hee brought \add it\add* neere to him, and he did eate: and he brought him wine, & he dranke.

\v 2 \f + \fr 31:2 \ft Hebr. as yesterday and the day before.\f*And Iacob behelde the countenance of Laban, and behold, it \add was\add* not toward him as before.
\v 3 And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Iacob, Returne vnto the land of thy fathers, and to thy kindred; and I wil be with thee.
\v 4 And Iacob sent and called Rachel and Leah, to the field vnto his flocke,
\v 5 And said vnto them, I see your fathers countenance, that it \add is\add* not toward mee as before: but the God of my father hath bene with me.
\v 6 And yee know, that with all my power I haue serued your father.
\v 7 And your father hath deceiued mee, and changed my wages ten times: but God suffered him not to hurt me.
\v 8 If hee said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages, then all the cattell bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ring-straked shalbe thy hire, then bare all the cattell ring-straked.
\v 9 Thus God hath taken away the cattell of your father, and giuen \add them\add* to mee.
\v 10 \f + \fr 31:10 \ft Or, hee goates.\f*And it came to passe at the time that the cattell conceiued, that I lifted vp mine eyes and saw in a dreame, and behold, the rammes which leaped vpon the cattell \add were\add* ring-straked, speckled and grisled.
\v 11 And the Angel of God spake vnto me in a dreame, \add saying\add*, Iacob; And I said, Here \add am\add* I.
\v 12 And hee said, Lift vp now thine eyes, and see, all the rammes which leape vpon the cattell \add are\add* ring-straked, speckled and grisled: for I haue seene all that Laban doeth vnto thee.

\v 14 And Rachel and Leah answered, and said vnto him; \add Is there\add* yet any portion or inheritance for vs in our fathers house?
\v 15 Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold vs, and hath quite deuoured also our money.
\v 16 For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that \add is\add* ours, and our childrens: now then whatsoeuer God hath said vnto thee, doe.

\v 25 ¶ Then Laban ouertooke Iacob. Now Iacob had pitched his tent in the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of Gilead.
\v 26 And Laban said to Iacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stollen away vnawares to me, and caried away my daughters, as captiues \add taken\add* with the sword?
\v 27 \f + \fr 31:27 \ft Hebr. hast stollen me.\f*Wherefore didst thou flie away secretly, and steale away from me, and didst not tell mee? that I might haue sent thee away with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harpe,

\v 29 It is in the power of my hand to doe you hurt: but the God of your father spake vnto mee yesternight, saying, Take thou heed, that thou speake not to Iacob either good or bad.
\v 30 And now \add though\add* thou wouldest needes bee gone, because thou sore longedst after thy fathers house; \add yet\add* wherefore hast thou stollen my gods?
\v 31 And Iacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid: for I said, Peraduenture thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me.
\v 32 With whomsoeuer thou findest thy gods, let him not liue: before our brethren discerne thou what \add is\add* thine with me, and take \add it\add* to thee: for Iacob knew not that Rachel had stollen them.
\v 33 And Laban went into Iacobs tent, and into Leahs tent, and into the two maid seruants tents: but he found \add them\add* not. Then went he out of Leahs tent, and entred into Rachels tent.

\v 36 ¶ And Iacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Iacob answered and said to Laban, what \add is\add* my trespasse? what \add is\add* my sinne, that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?
\v 37 \f + \fr 31:37 \ft Hebr. felt.\f*Whereas thou hast searched all my stuffe, what hast thou found of all thy houshold stuffe? set \add it\add* here before my brethren, and thy brethren, that they may iudge betwixt vs both.

\v 42 Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the feare of Isaac had bin with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now emptie: God hath seene mine affliction, and the labour of my hands, & rebuked \add thee\add* yesternight.
\v 43 ¶ And Laban answered and said vnto Iacob, \add These\add* daughters \add are\add* my daughters, and \add these\add* children \add are\add* my children, and \add these\add* cattell \add are\add* my cattell, and all that thou seest, \add is\add* mine: and what can I doe this day vnto these my daughters, or vnto their children which they haue borne?
\v 44 Now therefore come thou, let vs make a couenant, I and thou: and let it be for a witnesse betweene me and thee.
\v 45 And Iacob tooke a stone, and set it vp \add for\add* a pillar.
\v 46 And Iacob saide vnto his brethren, Gather stones: and they tooke stones, and made an heape, and they did eate there vpon the heape.

\v 5 And I haue oxen, and asses, flockes, and men seruants and women seruants: and I haue sent to tell my \nd LORD\nd*, that I may find grace in thy sight.

\v 7 Then Iacob was greatly afraid, and distressed, and he diuided the people that \add was\add* with him, and the flockes, and herdes, and the camels into two bands,

\v 13 ¶ And he lodged there that same night, and tooke of that which came to his hand, a present for Esau his brother:
