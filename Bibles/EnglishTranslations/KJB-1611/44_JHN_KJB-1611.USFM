\iex 1 The Diuinitie, Humanitie, and Office of Iesus Christ. 15 The testimonie of Iohn. 39 The calling of Andrew, Peter, &c.
\v 1 ¶ In the beginning was the Word, & the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
\v 2 \x + \xo 1:2 \xt Gen. 1.1.\x*The same was in the beginning with God.
\v 3 \x + \xo 1:3 \xt Col. 1.16.\x*All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.
\v 4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men.
\v 5 And the light shineth in darknesse, and the darknesse comprehended it not.
\v 6 ¶ \x + \xo 1:6 \xt Mat. 3.1.\x*There was a man sent from God, whose name \add was\add* Iohn.
\v 7 The same came for a witnesse, to beare witnesse of the light, that all \add men\add* through him might beleeue.
\v 8 Hee was not that light, but \add was sent\add* to beare witnesse of that light.
\v 9 \add That\add* was the true light, which lighteth euery man that commeth into the world.
\v 10 Hee was in the world, and \x + \xo 1:10 \xt Heb. 11.3.\x*the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.
\v 11 Hee came vnto his owne, and his owne receiued him not.
\v 12 But as many as receiued him, to them gaue hee \f + \fr 1:12 \ft Or, the right or priuiledge.\f*power to become the sonnes of God, \add euen\add* to them that beleeue on his Name:
\v 13 Which were borne, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
\v 14 \x + \xo 1:14 \xt Mat. 1.16.\x*And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among vs (& we beheld his glory, the glory as of the onely begotten of the Father) full of grace and trueth.
\v 15 ¶ Iohn bare witnesse of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that commeth after me, is preferred before me, for he was before me.
\v 16 And of his \x + \xo 1:16 \xt Col. 1.19.\x*fulnesse haue all wee receiued, and grace for grace.
\v 17 For the Law was giuen by Moses, \add but\add* grace and trueth came by Iesus Christ.
\v 18 \x + \xo 1:18 \xt 1.Iohn 4.12. 1.tim. 6.16.\x*No man hath seene God at any time: the onely begotten Sonne, which is in the bosome of the Father, he hath declared \add him\add*.
\v 19 ¶ And this is the record of Iohn, when the Iewes sent Priests and Leuites from Hierusalem, to aske him, Who art thou?
\v 20 And he confessed, and denied not: but confessed, I am not the Christ.
\v 21 And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou \f + \fr 1:21 \ft Or, a Prophet.\f*that Prophet? And hee answered, No.
\v 22 Then said they vnto him, Who art thou, that we may giue an answere to them that sent vs? What sayest thou of thy selfe?
\v 23 \x + \xo 1:23 \xt Mat. 3.3.\x*He said, I \add am\add* the voice of one crying in the wildernesse: Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the Prophet Esaias.
\v 24 And they which were sent, were of the Pharises.
\v 25 And they asked him, and said vnto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that Prophet?
\v 26 Iohn answered them, saying, I baptize with water, but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not,
\v 27 \x + \xo 1:27 \xt Mat. 3.11. acts 19.4.\x*He it is, who comming after me, is preferred before me, whose shoes latchet I am not worthy to vnloose.
\v 28 These things were done in Bethabara beyond Iordane, where Iohn was baptizing.
\v 29 ¶ The next day, Iohn seeth Iesus comming vnto him, and saith, Behold the Lambe of God, which \f + \fr 1:29 \ft Or, beareth.\f*taketh away the sinne of the world.
\v 30 This is he of whom I said, After me commeth a man, which is preferred before me: for he was before me.
\v 31 And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therfore am I come baptizing with water.
\v 32 \x + \xo 1:32 \xt Mat. 3.16.\x*And Iohn bare record saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heauen, like a Doue, and it abode vpon him.
\v 33 And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said vnto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, & remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the holy Ghost.
\v 34 And I saw, and bare record, that this is the sonne of God.
\v 35 ¶ Againe the next day after, Iohn stood, and two of his disciples.
\v 36 And looking vpon Iesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lambe of God.
\v 37 And the two disciples heard him speake, and they followed Iesus.
\v 38 Then Iesus turned, and saw them following, and saith vnto them, What seeke ye? They said vnto him, Rabbi, (which is to say being interpreted, Master) where \f + \fr 1:38 \ft Or, abidest.\f*dwellest thou?
\v 39 He saith vnto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was \f + \fr 1:39 \ft That was two houres before night.\f*about the tenth houre.
\v 40 One of the two which heard Iohn speake, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peters brother.
\v 41 He first findeth his owne brother Simon, and saith vnto him, We haue found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, \f + \fr 1:41 \ft Or, the anointed.\f*the Christ.
\v 42 And he brought him to Iesus. And when Iesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the sonne of Iona, thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, \f + \fr 1:42 \ft Or, Peter.\f*a stone.
\v 43 ¶ The day following, Iesus would goe foorth into Galilee, & findeth Philip, & saith vnto him, Follow me.
\v 44 Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the citie of Andrew and Peter.
\v 45 Philip findeth Nathaneel, and saith vnto him, We haue found him of whom\x + \xo 1:45 \xt Gen. 49.10. leuit. 18.18.\x*Moses in the Law, and the \x + \xo 1:45 \xt Esai. 4.2.\x*Prophets did write, Iesus of Nazareth the sonne of Ioseph.
\v 46 And Nathaneel said vnto him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith vnto him, Come and see.
\v 47 Iesus saw Nathaneel comming to him, and saith of him, Behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no guile.
\v 48 Nathaneel sayeth vnto him, Whence knowest thou me? Iesus answered, and said vnto him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast vnder the figge tree, I saw thee.
\v 49 Nathaneel answered, and saith vnto him, Rabbi, thou art the Sonne of God, thou art the king of Israel.
\v 50 Iesus answered, and said vnto him, Because I said vnto thee, I saw thee vnder the figge tree, beleeuest thou? thou shalt see greater things then these.
\v 51 And hee saith vnto him, Uerily, verily I say vnto you, heereafter yee shall see heauen open, and the Angels of God ascending, and descending vpon the sonne of man.

\iex 1 Christ turneth water into wine, 12 Departeth into Capernaum, and to Ierusalem, 14 Where hee purgeth the temple of buyers and sellers. 19 He foretelleth his death and resurrection. 23 Many beleeued because of his miracles, but he would not trust himselfe with them.
\v 1 ¶ And the third day there was a mariage in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Iesus was there.
\v 2 And both Iesus was called, and his disciples, to the mariage.
\v 3 And when they wanted wine, the mother of Iesus saith vnto him, They haue no wine.
\v 4 Iesus saith vnto her, Woman, what haue I to doe with thee? mine houre is not yet come.
\v 5 His mother saith vnto y\sup e\sup* seruants, Whatsoeuer he saith vnto you, doe \add it\add*.
\v 6 And there were set there sixe water pots of stone, after the maner of the purifying of the Iewes, conteining two or three firkins apeece.
\v 7 Iesus saith vnto them, Fill the water pots with water. And they filled them vp to the brimme.
\v 8 And hee saith vnto them, Drawe out now, and beare vnto the gouernor of the feast. And they bare \add it\add*.
\v 9 When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was, (but the seruants which drew the water knew) the gouernor of the feast called the bridegrome,
\v 10 And saith vnto him, Euery man at the beginning doth set foorth good wine, and when men haue well drunke, then that which is worse: \add but\add* thou hast kept the good wine vntill now.
\v 11 This beginning of miracles did Iesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory, and his disciples beleeued on him.
\v 12 ¶ After this hee went downe to Capernaum, hee and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples, and they continued there not many dayes.
\v 13 ¶ And the Iewes Passeouer was at hand, & Iesus went vp to Hierusalem
\v 14 And found in the Temple those that sold oxen, and sheepe, and doues, and the changers of money, sitting.
\v 15 And when he had made a scourge of small cordes, he droue them all out of the Temple, and the sheepe & the oxen, and powred out the changers money, and ouerthrew the tables,
\v 16 And said vnto them that sold doues Take these things hence, make not my fathers house an house of merchandize.
\v 17 And his disciples remembred that it was written, \x + \xo 2:17 \xt Psal. 69.9.\x*The zeale of thine house hath eaten me vp.
\v 18 ¶ Then answered the Iewes, and said vnto him, What signe shewest thou vnto vs, seeing that thou doest these things?
\v 19 Iesus answered, and said vnto them, \x + \xo 2:19 \xt Mat. 26.61.\x*Destroy this temple, and in three dayes I will raise it vp.
\v 20 Then said the Iewes, Fourty and six yeres was this Temple in building, and wilt thou reare it vp in three dayes?
\v 21 But he spake of the temple of his body.
\v 22 When therefore hee was risen from the dead, his disciples remembred that hee had said this vnto them: and they beleeued the Scripture, and the word which Iesus had said.
\v 23 ¶ Now when hee was in Hierusalem at the Passeouer, in the feast \add day\add*, many beleeued in his Name, when they saw the miracles which he did.
\v 24 But Iesus did not commit himselfe vnto them, because he knew al \add men\add*,
\v 25 And needed not that any should testifie of man: for hee knew what was in man.

\iex 1 Christ teacheth Nicodemus the necessitie of regeneration. 14 Of faith in his death. 16 The great loue of God towards the world. 18 Condemnation for vnbeliefe. 23 The baptisme, witnes & doctrine of Iohn concerning Christ.
\v 1 ¶ There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of y\sup e\sup* Iewes:
\v 2 The same came to Iesus by night, and said vnto him, Rabbi, wee know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can doe these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.
\v 3 Iesus answered, and said vnto him, Uerily, verily I say vnto thee, except a man be borne \f + \fr 3:3 \ft Or, from aboue.\f*againe, he cannot see the kingdome of God.
\v 4 Nicodemus saith vnto him, How can a man be borne when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mothers wombe, and be borne?
\v 5 Iesus answered, Uerily, verily I say vnto thee, except a man be borne of water and \add of\add* the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdome of God.
\v 6 That which is borne of the flesh, is flesh, and that which is borne of the spirit, is spirit.
\v 7 Marueile not that I saide vnto thee, Ye must be borne \f + \fr 3:7 \ft Or, from aboue.\f*againe.
\v 8 The winde bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tel whence it commeth, and whither it goeth: So is euery one that is borne of the Spirit.
\v 9 Nicodemus answered, and said vnto him, How can these things be?
\v 10 Iesus answered, and saide vnto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?
\v 11 Uerely, verely I say vnto thee, We speake that we doe know, and testifie that wee haue seene; and yee receiue not our witnesse.
\v 12 If I haue tolde you earthly things, and ye beleeue not: how shall ye beleeue if I tell you \add of\add* heauenly things?
\v 13 And no man hath ascended vp to heauen, but hee that came downe from heauen, \add euen\add* the Sonne of man which is in heauen.
\v 14 ¶ \x + \xo 3:14 \xt Num. 21.9.\x*And as Moses lifted vp the serpent in the wildernesse: euen so must the Sonne of man be lifted vp:
\v 15 That whosoeuer beleeueth in him, should not perish, but haue eternall life.
\v 16 ¶ \x + \xo 3:16 \xt 1.Iohn 4.9.\x*For God so loued y\sup e\sup* world, that he gaue his only begotten Sonne: that whosoeuer beleeueth in him, should not perish, but haue euerlasting life.
\v 17 \x + \xo 3:17 \xt Chap. 12.47.\x*For God sent not his Sonne into the world to condemne the world: but that the world through him might be saued.
\v 18 ¶ He that beleeueth on him, is not condemned: but hee that beleeueth not, is condemned already, because hee hath not beleeued in the Name of the onely begotten Sonne of God.
\v 19 And this is the condemnation, \x + \xo 3:19 \xt Cha. 1.4.\x*that light is come into the world, and men loued darknesse rather then light, because their deedes were euill.
\v 20 For euery one that doeth euill, hateth the light, neither commeth to the light, lest his deeds should be \f + \fr 3:20 \ft Or, discouered.\f*reproued.
\v 21 But hee that doeth trueth, commeth to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.
\v 22 ¶ After these things, came Iesus and his disciples into the land of Iudea, and there hee taried with them, \x + \xo 3:22 \xt Chap. 4.2.\x*and baptized.
\v 23 ¶ And Iohn also was baptizing in Aenon, neere to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.
\v 24 For Iohn was not yet cast into prison.
\v 25 ¶ Then there arose a question between \add some\add* of Iohns disciples and the Iewes, about purifying.
\v 26 And they came vnto Iohn, and said vnto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Iordane, \x + \xo 3:26 \xt Chap. 1.7,34.\x*to whom thou barest witnesse, behold, the same baptizeth, and all \add men\add* come to him.
\v 27 Iohn answered, and said, \x + \xo 3:27 \xt Heb.5.4.\x*A man can \f + \fr 3:27 \ft Or, take vnto himselfe.\f*receiue nothing, except it be giuen him from heauen.
\v 28 Ye your selues beare me witnesse, that I said, \x + \xo 3:28 \xt Chap. 1.20.\x*I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.
\v 29 He that hath the bride, is the bridegrome: but the friend of the bridegrome, which standeth and heareth him, reioyceth greatly because of the bridegromes voice: This my ioy therefore is fulfilled.
\v 30 Hee must increase, but I \add must\add* decrease.
\v 31 Hee that commeth from aboue, is aboue all: hee that is of the earth, is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: hee that cōmeth from heauen is aboue all:
\v 32 And what hee hath seene and heard, that he testifieth, and no man receiueth his testimony:
\v 33 He that hath receiued his testimonie, \x + \xo 3:33 \xt Rom. 3.4.\x*hath set to his seale, that God is true.
\v 34 For he whom God hath sent, speaketh the words of God: For God giueth not the Spirit by measure \add vnto him\add*.
\v 35 \x + \xo 3:35 \xt Matth. 11.27.\x*The Father loueth the Sonne, and hath giuen al things into his hand.
\v 36 \x + \xo 3:36 \xt Habac. 2.4. 1.iohn 5.10.\x*He that beleeueth on the Sonne, hath euerlasting life: and he that beleeueth not the Sonne, shall not see life: but the wrath of God abideth on him.

\iex 1 Christ talketh with a woman of Samaria, and reueileth himselfe vnto her. 27 His disciples marueile. 31 He declareth to them his zeale to Gods glory. 39 Many Samaritanes beleeue on him. 43 He departeth into Galile, and healeth the Rulers sonne that lay sicke at Capernaum.
\v 1 ¶ When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Iesus made and baptized moe disciples then Iohn,
\v 2 (Though Iesus himselfe baptized not, but his disciples:)
\v 3 He left Iudea, and departed againe into Galile.
\v 4 And hee must needs goe thorow Samaria.
\v 5 Then commeth he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, neere to the parcell of ground \x + \xo 4:5 \xt Gen. 33.12. and 48.12. iohn. 24.33.\x*that Iacob gaue to his sonne Ioseph.
\v 6 Now Iacobs Well was there. Iesus therefore being wearied with \add his\add* iourney, sate thus on the Well: \add and\add* it was about the sixth houre.
\v 7 There commeth a woman of Samaria to draw water: Iesus sayth vnto her, Giue me to drinke.
\v 8 For his disciples were gone away vnto the city to buy meate.
\v 9 Then saith the woman of Samaria vnto him, How is it that thou, being a Iewe, askest drinke of me, which am a woman of Samaria? For the Iewes haue no dealings with the Samaritanes.
\v 10 Iesus answered, and said vnto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that sayth to thee, Giue me to drinke; thou wouldest haue asked of him, and hee would haue giuen thee liuing water.
\v 11 The woman saith vnto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to drawe with, and the Well is deepe: from whence then hast thou that liuing water?
\v 12 Art thou greater then our father Iacob, which gaue vs the Well, and dranke thereof himselfe, and his children, and his cattell?
\v 13 Iesus answered, and said vnto her, Whosoeuer drinketh of this water, shall thirst againe:
\v 14 But whosoeuer drinketh of the water that I shal giue him, shall neuer thirst: but the water that I shall giue him, shalbe in him a well of water springing vp into euerlasting life.
\v 15 The woman saith vnto him, Sir, giue me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.
\v 16 Iesus saith vnto her, Goe, call thy husband, and come hither.
\v 17 The woman answered, and said, I haue no husband. Iesus said vnto her, Thou hast well said, I haue no husband:
\v 18 For thou hast had fiue husbands, and he whom thou now hast, is not thy husband: In that saidest thou truely.
\v 19 The woman saith vnto him, Sir, I perceiue that thou art a Prophet.
\v 20 Our fathers worshipped in this mountaine, and ye say, that \x + \xo 4:20 \xt Deu. 12.5.\x*in Hierusalem is the place where men ought to worship.
\v 21 Iesus saith vnto her, Woman, beleeue me, the houre commeth when ye shall neither in this mountaine, nor yet at Hierusalem, worship the Father.
\v 22 Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for saluation is of the Iewes.
\v 23 But the houre commeth, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit, and in trueth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.
\v 24 \x + \xo 4:24 \xt 2.Cor. 3.17.\x*God \add is\add* a Spirit, and they that worship \add him\add*, must worship him in spirit, and in trueth.
\v 25 The woman saith vnto him, I know that Messias commeth, which is called Christ: when he is come, hee will tell vs all things.
\v 26 Iesus sayth vnto her, I that speake vnto thee, am hee.
\v 27 ¶ And vpon this came his disciples, and marueiled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou, or, Why talkest thou with her?
\v 28 The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and sayth to the men,
\v 29 Come, see a man, which tolde me all things that euer I did: Is not this the Christ?
\v 30 Then they went out of the citie, and came vnto him.
\v 31 ¶ In the meane while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eate.
\v 32 But hee said vnto them, I haue meate to eate that ye know not of.
\v 33 Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him \add ought\add* to eate?
\v 34 Iesus saith vnto them, My meat is, to doe the will of him that sent mee, and to finish his worke.
\v 35 Say not ye, There are yet foure moneths, and \add then\add* commeth haruest? Behold, I say vnto you, Lift vp your eyes, and looke on the fields: \x + \xo 4:35 \xt Mat. 9.37.\x*for they are white already to haruest.
\v 36 And hee that reapeth receiueth wages, and gathereth fruite vnto life eternall: that both he that soweth, and he that reapeth, may reioyce together.
\v 37 And herein is that saying true: One soweth, and another reapeth.
\v 38 I sent you to reape that, whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and yee are entred into their labours.
\v 39 ¶ And many of the Samaritanes of that citie beleeued on him, for the saying of the woman, which testified, Hee told me all that euer I did.
\v 40 So when the Samaritanes were come vnto him, they besought him that he would tarie with them, and he abode there two dayes.
\v 41 And many moe beleeued, because of his owne word:
\v 42 And said vnto the woman, Now we beleeue, not because of thy saying, for we haue heard \add him\add* our selues, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Sauiour of the world.
\v 43 ¶ \x + \xo 4:43 \xt Matth. 13.57.\x*Now after two dayes he departed thence, and went into Galilee:
\v 44 For Iesus himselfe testified, that a Prophet hath no honour in his owne countrey.
\v 45 Then when hee was come into Galilee, the Galileans receiued him, hauing seene all the things that hee did at Hierusalem at the Feast: for they also went vnto the Feast.
\v 46 So Iesus came againe into Cana of Galilee, \x + \xo 4:46 \xt Chap. 2.1.\x*where hee made the water wine. And there was a certaine \f + \fr 4:46 \ft Or, Courtier, or ruler.\f*noble man, whose sonne was sicke at Capernaum.
\v 47 When he heard that Iesus was come out of Iudea into Galilee, hee went vnto him, and besought him that he would come downe, and heale his sonne: for he was at the point of death.
\v 48 Then said Iesus vnto him, Except ye see signes and wonders, yee will not beleeue.
\v 49 The noble man saith vnto him, Syr, come downe ere my child die.
\v 50 Iesus saith vnto him, Go thy way, thy sonne liueth. And the man beleeued the word that Iesus had spoken vnto him, and he went his way.
\v 51 And as he was now going down, his seruants met him, and told \add him\add*, saying, Thy sonne liueth.
\v 52 Then inquired hee of them the houre when he began to amend: and they said vnto him, Yesterday at the seuenth houre the feuer left him.
\v 53 So the father knewe that \add it was\add* at the same houre, in the which Iesus said vnto him, Thy sonne liueth, and himselfe beleeued, and his whole house.
\v 54 This \add is\add* againe the second miracle \add that\add* Iesus did, when hee was come out of Iudea into Galilee.

\iex 1 Iesus on the Sabbath day cureth him that was diseased eight & thirtie yeeres. 10 The Iewes therefore cauill, and persecute him for it. 17 He answereth for himselfe, and reprooueth them, shewing by the testimonie of his Father, 32 of Iohn, 36 of his workes, 39 and of the Scriptures, who he is.
\v 1 ¶ After \x + \xo 5:1 \xt Leuit. 23.2. deut. 16.\x*this there was a feast of the Iewes, and Iesus went vp to Hierusalem.
\v 2 Now there is at Hierusalem by the sheepe \f + \fr 5:2 \ft Or, gate.\f*\add market\add*, a poole, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, hauing fiue porches.
\v 3 In these lay a great multitude of impotent folke, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the mouing of the water.
\v 4 For an Angel went downe at a certaine season into the poole, and troubled the water: whosoeuer then first after the troubling of the water stepped in, was made whole of whatsoeuer disease he had.
\v 5 And a certaine man was there, which had an infirmitie thirtie and eight yeeres.
\v 6 When Iesus saw him lie, & knew that hee had beene now a long time \add in that case\add*, he sayth vnto him, Wilt thou be made whole?
\v 7 The impotent man answered him, Sir, I haue no man when the water is troubled, to put mee into the poole: but while I am comming, another steppeth downe before me.
\v 8 Iesus sayth vnto him, Rise, take vp thy bed, and walke.
\v 9 And immediatly the man was made whole, and tooke vp his bed, and walked: And on the same day was the Sabbath.
\v 10 ¶ The Iewes therefore said vnto him that was cured, It is the Sabbath day, \x + \xo 5:10 \xt Ier. 17.22\x*it is not lawfull for thee to cary \add thy\add* bed.
\v 11 He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said vnto me, Take vp thy bed, and walke.
\v 12 Then asked they him, What man is that which said vnto thee, Take vp thy bed, and walke?
\v 13 And he that was healed, wist not who it was: for Iesus had conueyed himselfe away, \f + \fr 5:13 \ft Or, from the multitude that was.\f*a multitude being in \add that\add* place.
\v 14 Afterward Iesus findeth him in the Temple, & said vnto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sinne no more, lest a worse thing come vnto thee.
\v 15 The man departed, and tolde the Iewes that it was Iesus which had made him whole.
\v 16 And therefore did the Iewes persecute Iesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the Sabbath day.
\v 17 ¶ But Iesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, & I worke.
\v 18 Therefore the Iewes sought the more to kill him, not onely because hee had broken the Sabbath, but said also, that God was his father, making himselfe equall with God.
\v 19 Then answered Iesus, and saide vnto them, Uerily, verily I say vnto you, The sonne can doe nothing of himselfe, but what he seeth the Father doe: for what things soeuer he doeth, these also doth the sonne likewise.
\v 20 For the father loueth the sonne, and sheweth him all things that himselfe doth: & he will shew him greater works then these, that ye may marueile.
\v 21 For as the Father raiseth vp the dead, and quickeneth \add them\add*: euen so the Sonne quickeneth whom he will.
\v 22 For the Father iudgeth no man: but hath committed all iudgement vnto the Sonne:
\v 23 That all \add men\add* should honour the Son, euen as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not y\sup e\sup* Sonne, honoreth not y\sup e\sup* Father which hath sent him.
\v 24 Uerily, verily I say vnto you, Hee that heareth my word, & beleeueth on him that sent mee, hath euerlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation: but is passed from death vnto life.
\v 25 Uerily, verily I say vnto you, The houre is comming, & now is, when the dead shall heare the voice of the Sonne of God: and they that heare, shall liue.
\v 26 For as the Father hath life in himselfe: so hath he giuen to the Sonne to haue life in himselfe:
\v 27 And hath giuen him authority to execute iudgement also, because he is the Sonne of man.
\v 28 Marueile not at this: for the houre is comming, in the which all that are in the graues shall heare his voice,
\v 29 And shall come foorth, \x + \xo 5:29 \xt Matth. 25.46.\x*they that haue done good, vnto the resurrection of life, and they that haue done euill, vnto the resurrection of damnation.
\v 30 I can of mine owne selfe doe nothing: as I heare, I iudge: and my iudgement is iust, because I seeke not mine owne will, but the will of the Father, which hath sent me.
\v 31 \x + \xo 5:31 \xt Chap. 8.14.\x*If I beare witnesse of my selfe, my witnesse is not true.
\v 32 ¶ \x + \xo 5:32 \xt Matth. 3.17.\x*There is another that beareth witnesse of me, & I know that the witnesse which he witnesseth of me, is true.
\v 33 Ye sent vnto Iohn, \x + \xo 5:33 \xt Chap. 1.7.\x*and he bare witnesse vnto the trueth.
\v 34 But I receiue not testimonie from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saued.
\v 35 He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to reioyce in his light.
\v 36 ¶ But I haue greater witnesse then \add that\add* of Iohn: for the workes which the Father hath giuen me to finish, the same workes that I doe, beare witnesse of mee, that the Father hath sent me.
\v 37 And the Father himselfe which hath sent me, \x + \xo 5:37 \xt Matth. 3.17. and 17.5.\x*hath borne witnesse of me. Ye haue neither heard his voyce at any time, \x + \xo 5:37 \xt Deut. 4.12.\x*nor seene his shape.
\v 38 And ye haue not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye beleeue not.
\v 39 ¶ Search the Scriptures, for in them ye thinke ye haue eternall life, and they are they which testifie of me.
\v 40 And ye will not come to me, that ye might haue life.
\v 41 I receiue not honour from men.
\v 42 But I know you, that ye haue not the loue of God in you.
\v 43 I am come in my Fathers name, and ye receiue me not: if another shall come in his owne Name, him ye will receiue.
\v 44 \x + \xo 5:44 \xt Chap. 12.43.\x*How can ye beleeue, which receiue honour one of another, & seeke not the honour that commeth from God onely?
\v 45 Doe not thinke that I will accuse you to the Father: there is \add one\add* that accuseth you, \add euen\add* Moses, in whom ye trust?
\v 46 For had ye beleeued Moses, ye would haue beleeued me: \x + \xo 5:46 \xt Gen. 3.15. deut. 18.15\x*for he wrote of me.
\v 47 But if ye beleeue not his writings, how shall ye beleeue my words?

\iex 1 Christ feedeth fiue thousand men with fiue loaues and two fishes. 15 Thereupon the people would haue made him King. 16 But withdrawing himselfe, he walked on the sea to his disciples: 26 Reprooueth the people flocking after him, and all the fleshly hearers of his word: 32 Declareth himselfe to be the Bread of life to beleeuers. 66 Many disciples depart from him. 68 Peter confesseth him. 70 Iudas is a deuil.
\v 1 ¶ After these things Iesus went ouer the sea of Galilee, which is \add the sea\add* of Tiberias:
\v 2 And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which hee did on them that were diseased.
\v 3 And Iesus went vp into a mountaine, and there hee sate with his disciples.
\v 4 \x + \xo 6:4 \xt Leuit. 23.5. deut. 16.1.\x*And the Passeouer, a feast of the Iewes, was nigh.
\v 5 ¶ \x + \xo 6:5 \xt Matt. 14.15.\x*When Iesus then lift vp \add his\add* eyes, and saw a great company come vnto him, he saith vnto Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eate?
\v 6 (And this he said to proue him: for he himselfe knew what he would doe)
\v 7 Philip answered him, Two hundred peny-worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that euery one of them may take a litle.
\v 8 One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peters brother, saith vnto him,
\v 9 There is a lad here, which hath fiue barley loaues, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?
\v 10 And Iesus said, Make the men sit downe. Now there was much grasse in the place. So the men sate downe, in number about fiue thousand.
\v 11 And Iesus tooke the loaues, and when he had giuen thankes, hee distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that were set downe, and likewise of the fishes, as much as they would.
\v 12 When they were filled, he said vnto his disciples, Gather vp the fragments that remaine, that nothing be lost.
\v 13 Therefore they gathered \add them\add* together, and filled twelue baskets with the fragments of the fiue barley loaues, which remained ouer and aboue, vnto them that had eaten.
\v 14 Then those men, when they had seene the miracle that Iesus did, said, This is of a trueth that Prophet that should come into the world.
\v 15 ¶ When Iesus therefore perceiued that they would come and take him by force, to make him a King, hee departed againe into a mountaine, himselfe alone.
\v 16 \x + \xo 6:16 \xt Matth. 14.23.\x*And when euen was \add now\add* come, his disciples went downe vnto the sea,
\v 17 And entred into a ship, and went ouer the sea towards Capernaum: and it was now darke, and Iesus was not come to them.
\v 18 And the sea arose, by reason of a great winde that blew.
\v 19 So when they had rowed about fiue and twentie, or thirtie furlongs, they see Iesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh vnto the ship: and they were afraid.
\v 20 But he saith vnto them, It is I, be not afraid.
\v 21 Then they willingly receiued him into the ship, and immediatly the ship was at the land whither they went.
\v 22 ¶ The day following, when the people which stood on the other side of the sea, saw that there was none other boat there, saue that one whereinto his disciples were entred, and that Iesus went not with his disciples into the boat, but \add that\add* his disciples were gone away alone:
\v 23 Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias, nigh vnto the place where they did eate bread, after that the Lord had giuen thankes:
\v 24 When the people therefore saw that Iesus was not there, neither his disciples, they also tooke shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Iesus.
\v 25 And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they saide vnto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?
\v 26 Iesus answered them, and said, Uerely, verely I say vnto you, Ye seeke me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because yee did eate of the loaues, and were filled.
\v 27 \f + \fr 6:27 \ft Or, worke not.\f*Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat which endureth vnto euerlasting life, which the Sonne of man shall giue vnto you: \x + \xo 6:27 \xt Matth. 3.17.\x*for him hath God the Father sealed.
\v 28 Then said they vnto him, What shall we doe, that we might worke the workes of God?
\v 29 Iesus answered, and said vnto them, \x + \xo 6:29 \xt 1.Ioh. 3.13.\x*This is the worke of God, that ye beleeue on him whom he hath sent.
\v 30 They said therefore vnto him, What signe shewest thou then, that we may see, and beleeue thee? What doest thou worke?
\v 31 \x + \xo 6:31 \xt Exod. 16.15. numb. 11.7.\x*Our fathers did eate Manna in the desert, as it is written, \x + \xo 6:31 \xt Psal. 78.25.\x*He gaue them bread from heauen to eate.
\v 32 Then Iesus said vnto them, Uerely, verely I say vnto you, Moses gaue you not that bread from heauen, but my Father giueth you the true bread from heauen.
\v 33 For the bread of God is hee which commeth downe from heauen, and giueth life vnto the world.
\v 34 Then said they vnto him, Lord, euermore giue vs this bread.
\v 35 And Iesus said vnto them, I am the bread of life: hee that commeth to me, shall neuer hunger: and he that beleeueth on me, shall neuer thirst.
\v 36 But I said vnto you, that ye also haue seene me, and beleeue not.
\v 37 All that the Father giueth mee, shall come to mee; and him that commeth to me, I will in no wise cast out.
\v 38 For I came downe from heauen, not to doe mine owne will, but the will of him that sent me.
\v 39 And this is the Fathers wil which hath sent me, that of all which he hath giuen mee, I should lose nothing, but should raise it vp againe at the last day.
\v 40 And this is the will of him that sent me, that euery one which seeth the Sonne, and beleeueth on him, may haue euerlasting life: and I will raise him vp at the last day.
\v 41 The Iewes then murmured at him, because hee said, I am the bread which came downe from heauen.
\v 42 And they said, \x + \xo 6:42 \xt Mat. 13.55.\x*Is not this Iesus the sonne of Ioseph, whose father and mother we know? How is it then that hee sayth, I came downe from heauen?
\v 43 Iesus therefore answered, and said vnto them, Murmure not among your selues.
\v 44 No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me, draw him: and I will raise him vp at the last day.
\v 45 \x + \xo 6:45 \xt Esai 54.13. iere. 31.34.\x*It is written in the Prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Euery man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of the Father, commeth vnto me,
\v 46 Not that any man hath seene the Father; \x + \xo 6:46 \xt Mat. 11.27.\x*saue hee which is of God, hee hath seene the Father.
\v 47 Uerely, verely I say vnto you, Hee that beleeueth on me, hath euerlasting life.
\v 48 I am that bread of life.
\v 49 Your fathers did eate Manna in the wildernesse, and are dead.
\v 50 This is the bread which commeth downe from heauen, that a man may eate thereof, and not die.
\v 51 I am the liuing bread, which came downe from heauen. If any man eate of this bread, he shall liue for euer: and the bread that I will giue, is my flesh, which I will giue for the life of the world.
\v 52 The Iewes therefore stroue amongst themselues, saying, How can this man giue vs \add his\add* flesh to eate?
\v 53 Then Iesus sayd vnto them, Uerely, verely I say vnto you, Except yee eate the flesh of the sonne of man, and drinke his blood, yee haue no life in you.
\v 54 Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternall life, and I will raise him vp at the last day.
\v 55 For my flesh is meate indeed, and my blood is drinke indeed.
\v 56 He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.
\v 57 As the liuing Father hath sent me, and I liue by the Father: so, he that eateth me, euen he shall liue by me.
\v 58 This is that bread which came downe from heauen: not as your fathers did eate Manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread, shall liue for euer.
\v 59 These things said hee in the Synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
\v 60 Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard \add this\add*, said, This is an hard saying, who can heare it?
\v 61 When Iesus knew in himselfe, that his disciples murmured at it, hee said vnto them, Doeth this offend you?
\v 62 \x + \xo 6:62 \xt Cha. 3.13.\x*\add What\add* and if yee shall see the sonne of man ascend vp where hee was before?
\v 63 It is the Spirit that quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing: the wordes that I speake vnto you, \add they\add* are Spirit, and \add they\add* are life.
\v 64 But there are some of you that beleeue not. For Iesus knew from the beginning, who they were that beleeued not, and who should betray him.
\v 65 And he said, Therefore said I vnto you, that no man can come vnto me, except it were giuen vnto him of my Father.
\v 66 ¶ From that \add time\add* many of his disciples went backe, and walked no more with him.
\v 67 Then said Iesus vnto the twelue, Will ye also goe away?
\v 68 Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we goe? Thou hast the words of eternall life.
\v 69 \x + \xo 6:69 \xt Matth. 16 16.\x*And we beleeue and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Sonne of the liuing God.
\v 70 Iesus answered them, Haue not I chosen you twelue, and one of you is a deuill?
\v 71 He spake of Iudas Iscariot \add the sonne\add* of Simon: for hee it was that should betray him, being one of the twelue.

\iex Iesus reprooueth the ambition and boldnesse of his kinsemen: 10 goeth vp from Galilee to the feast of Tabernacles, 14 teacheth in the Temple. 40 Diuers opinions of him among the people. 45 The Pharisees are angry that their officers tooke him not, & chide with Nicodemus for taking his part.
\v 1 ¶ After these things, Iesus walked in Galilee: for hee would not walk in Iurie, because the Iewes sought to kill him.
\v 2 \f + \fr 7:2 \ft Leuit. 23.\f*Now the Iewes feast of Tabernacles was at hand.
\v 3 His brethren therefore saide vnto him, Depart hence, and go into Iudea, that thy Disciples also may see the works that thou doest.
\v 4 For \add there is\add* no man \add that\add* doth any thing in secret, and hee himselfe seeketh to be knowen openly: If thou doe these things, shew thy selfe to y\sup e\sup* world.
\v 5 For neither did his brethren beleeue in him.
\v 6 Then Iesus said vnto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.
\v 7 The world cannot hate you, but me it hateth, because I testifie of it, that the workes thereof are euill.
\v 8 Goe ye vp vnto this feast: I goe not vp yet vnto this feast, \x + \xo 7:8 \xt Cha. 8.20\x*for my time is not yet full come.
\v 9 When he had said these words vnto them, he abode \add still\add* in Galilee.
\v 10 ¶ But when his brethren were gone vp, then went he also vp vnto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.
\v 11 Then the Iewes sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?
\v 12 And there was much murmuring among the people, concerning him: For some said, Hee is a good man: Others said, Nay, but he deceiueth the people.
\v 13 Howbeit, no man spake openly of him, for feare of the Iewes.
\v 14 ¶ Now about the middest of the feast, Iesus went vp into the Temple, and taught.
\v 15 And the Iewes marueiled, saying, How knoweth this man\f + \fr 7:15 \ft Or, learning.\f*letters, hauing neuer learned?
\v 16 Iesus answered them, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.
\v 17 If any man will doe his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or \add whether\add* I speake of my selfe.
\v 18 He that speaketh of himselfe, seeketh his owne glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no vnrighteousnesse is in him.
\v 19 \x + \xo 7:19 \xt Exo. 24.3.\x*Did not Moses giue you the Law, and \add yet\add* none of you keepeth the Law? \x + \xo 7:19 \xt Cha. 5.18\x*Why goe ye about to kill me?
\v 20 The people answered, and sayd, Thou hast a deuill: Who goeth about to kill thee?
\v 21 Iesus answered, and saide vnto them, I haue done one worke, and yee all marueile.
\v 22 \x + \xo 7:22 \xt Leui. 12.3.\x*Moses therefore gaue vnto you Circumcision (not because it is of Moses, \x + \xo 7:22 \xt Gen. 17.10\x*but of the fathers) and yee on the Sabbath day circumcise a man.

\v 24 \x + \xo 7:24 \xt Deu. 1.16\x*Iudge not according to the appearance, but iudge righteous iudgement.
\v 25 Then said some of them of Hierusalem, Is not this hee, whome they seeke to kill?
\v 26 But loe, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing vnto him: Doe the rulers know indeede that this is the very Christ?
\v 27 Howbeit wee know this man whence he is: but when Christ commeth, no man knoweth whence he is.
\v 28 Then cried Iesus in the Temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am, and I am not come of my selfe, but he that sent me, is true, whom ye know not.
\v 29 But I know him, for I am from him, and he hath sent me.
\v 30 Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his houre was not yet come.
\v 31 And many of the people beleeued on him, & said, When Christ commeth, will hee doe moe miracles then these which this \add man\add* hath done?
\v 32 ¶ The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him: And the Pharisees and the chiefe Priests sent officers to take him.
\v 33 Then said Iesus vnto them, Yet a litle while am I with you, and \add then\add* I goe vnto him that sent me.
\v 34 \x + \xo 7:34 \xt Chap. 13.33.\x*Ye shall seeke me, and shall not find \add me\add*: and where I am, \add thither\add* yee cannot come.
\v 35 Then saide the Iewes among themselues, Whither will hee goe, that we shall not find him? will he goe vnto the dispersed among the \f + \fr 7:35 \ft Or, Greeks.\f*Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?
\v 36 What maner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seeke \add me\add*, and shall not find me? and where I am, \add thither\add* ye cannot come?
\v 37 \x + \xo 7:37 \xt Leuit. 23.36.\x*In the last day, that great \add day\add* of the feast, Iesus stood, and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come vnto me, and drinke.
\v 38 \x + \xo 7:38 \xt Deut. 18.15.\x*He that beleeueth on me, as the Scripture hath saide, out of his belly shall flow riuers of liuing water.
\v 39 \x + \xo 7:39 \xt Ioel. 2.28. esai. 44.3.\x*(But this spake he of the Spirit which they that beleeue on him, should receiue. For the holy Ghost was not yet \add giuen\add*, because that Iesus was not yet glorified.)
\v 40 ¶ Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, saide, Of a trueth this is the Prophet.
\v 41 Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?
\v 42 \x + \xo 7:42 \xt Mat. 2.5.\x*Hath not the Scripture saide, that Christ commeth of the seede of Dauid, and out of the towne of Bethlehem, where Dauid was?
\v 43 So there was diuision among the people because of him.
\v 44 And some of them would haue taken him, but no man layed hands on him.
\v 45 ¶ Then came the officers to the chiefe Priests and Pharises, and they said vnto them, Why haue ye not brought him?
\v 46 The officers answered, Neuer man spake like this man.
\v 47 Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceiued?
\v 48 Haue any of the rulers, or of the Pharises beleeued on him?
\v 49 But this people who knoweth not the Law, are cursed.

\iex 1 Christ deliuereth the woman taken in adultery. 12 He preacheth himselfe the light of the world, and iustifieth his Doctrine: 33 Answereth the Iewes that boasted of Abraham, 59 And conueigheth himselfe from their crueltie.
\v 1 ¶ Iesus went vnto y\sup e\sup* Mount of Oliues:
\v 2 And earely in the morning hee came againe into the Temple, and all the people came vnto him, and he sate downe, and taught them.
\v 3 And the Scribes and Pharisees brought vnto him a woman taken in adultery, and when they had set her in the mids,
\v 4 They say vnto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.
\v 5 \x + \xo 8:5 \xt Leuit. 20.10.\x*Now Moses in the Law commanded vs, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?
\v 6 This they said, tempting him, that they might haue to accuse him. But Iesus stouped downe, and with \add his\add* finger wrote on the ground \add as though he heard them not\add*.
\v 7 So when they continued asking him, hee lift vp himselfe, and saide vnto them, \x + \xo 8:7 \xt Deut. 17.7.\x*Hee that is without sinne among you, let him first cast a stone at her.
\v 8 And againe, hee stouped downe, and wrote on the ground.
\v 9 And they which heard \add it\add*, being conuicted by their owne conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, \add euen\add* vnto the last: and Iesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.
\v 10 When Iesus had lift vp himselfe, and saw none but the woman, hee said vnto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? Hath no man condemned thee?
\v 11 She saide, No man, Lord. And Iesus saide vnto her, Neither doe I condemne thee: Goe, and sinne no more.
\v 12 ¶ Then spake Iesus againe vnto them, saying, \x + \xo 8:12 \xt Chap. 1.5. and 9.5.\x*I am the light of the world: he that followeth mee, shall not walke in darkenesse, but shall haue the light of life.
\v 13 The Pharisees therefore said vnto him, Thou bearest record of thy selfe, thy record is not true.

\v 15 Yee iudge after the flesh, I iudge no man.
\v 16 And yet if I iudge, my iudgement is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.
\v 17 \x + \xo 8:17 \xt Deut. 17.6. matt. 18.16.\x*It is also written in your Law, that the testimonie of two men is true.
\v 18 I am one that beare witnesse of my selfe, and the Father that sent mee, beareth witnesse of me.
\v 19 Then said they vnto him, Where is thy Father? Iesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had knowen mee, yee should haue knowen my Father also.
\v 20 These words spake Iesus in the treasury, as hee taught in the Temple: and no man layd hands on him, for his houre was not yet come.
\v 21 Then saide Iesus againe vnto them, I goe my way, and ye shall seeke me, & shall die in your sinnes: Whither I goe, ye cannot come.
\v 22 Then said the Iewes, Will hee kill himselfe? because he saith, Whither I goe, ye cannot come.
\v 23 And hee said vnto them, Yee are from beneath, I am from aboue: Yee are of this world, I am not of this world.
\v 24 I said therefore vnto you, that ye shall die in your sinnes. For if yee beleeue not that I am hee, yee shall die in your sinnes.
\v 25 Then said they vnto him, Who art thou? And Iesus saith vnto them, Euen \add the same\add* that I saide vnto you from the beginning.
\v 26 I haue many things to say, and to iudge of you: But hee that sent mee is true, and I speake to the world, those things which I haue heard of him.
\v 27 They vnderstood not that hee spake to them of the Father.
\v 28 Then saide Iesus vnto them, When yee haue lift vp the Sonne of man, then shall ye know that I am \add he\add*, and \add that\add* I doe nothing of my selfe: but as my Father hath taught mee, I speake these things.
\v 29 And he that sent me, is with me: the Father hath not left mee alone: for I doe alwayes those things that please him.
\v 30 As hee spake those words, many beleeued on him.
\v 31 Then said Iesus to those Iewes which beleeued on him, If ye continue in my word, \add then\add* are yee my disciples indeed.
\v 32 And ye shall know the Trueth, and the Trueth shall make you free.
\v 33 ¶ They answered him, We be Abraham seed, and were neuer in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Yee shall be made free?
\v 34 Iesus answered them, Uerily, verily I say vnto you, \x + \xo 8:34 \xt Rom. 6.20. 2.pet. 2.19.\x*Whosoeuer committeth sinne, is the seruant of sinne.
\v 35 And the seruant abideth not in the house for euer: \add but\add* the Sonne abideth euer.
\v 36 If the Sonne therfore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.
\v 37 I know that yee are Abrahams seed, but ye seeke to kill mee, because my word hath no place in you.
\v 38 I speake that which I haue seene with my Father: and ye do that which ye haue seene with your father.
\v 39 They answered, and said vnto him, Abraham is our father. Iesus sayth vnto them, If yee were Abrahams children, ye would doe the works of Abraham.
\v 40 But now yee seeke to kill me, a man that hath tolde you the trueth, which I haue heard of God: this did not Abraham.
\v 41 Ye doe the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not borne of fornication, wee haue one Father, \add euen\add* God.
\v 42 Iesus said vnto them, If God were your Father, yee would loue me, for I proceeded foorth, and came from God: neither came I of my selfe, but he sent me.
\v 43 Why doe yee not vnderstand my speech? \add euen\add* because yee cannot heare my word.
\v 44 \x + \xo 8:44 \xt 1.Ioh. 3.8.\x*Ye are of \add your\add* father the deuill, and the lusts of your father ye will doe: hee was a murtherer from the beginning, and abode not in the trueth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his owne: for he is a liar, and the father of it.
\v 45 And because I tell \add you\add* the truth, ye beleeue me not.
\v 46 Which of you conuinceth mee of sinne? And if I say the trueth, why doe ye not beleeue me?
\v 47 \x + \xo 8:47 \xt 1.Ioh. 4.6.\x*He that is of God, heareth Gods words: ye therefore heare \add them\add* not, because ye are not of God.
\v 48 Then answered the Iewes, and said vnto him, Say wee not well that thou art a Samaritane, & hast a deuill?
\v 49 Iesus answered, I haue not a deuill: but I honour my Father, and ye doe dishonour me.
\v 50 And I seeke not mine owne glory, there is one that seeketh & iudgeth.
\v 51 Uerely, verely I say vnto you, If a man keepe my saying, hee shall neuer see death.
\v 52 Then said the Iewes vnto him, Now we know that thou hast a deuill. Abraham is dead, and the Prophets: and thou sayest, If a man keepe my saying, he shall neuer taste of death.
\v 53 Art thou greater then our father Abraham, which is dead? and the Prophets are dead: whom makest thou thy selfe?
\v 54 Iesus answered, If I honour myselfe, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me, of whom ye say, that he is your God:
\v 55 Yet ye haue not knowen him, but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shalbe a lyar like vnto you: but I know him, and keepe his saying.
\v 56 Your father Abraham reioyced to see my day: and he saw \add it\add*, & was glad.
\v 57 Then said the Iewes vnto him, Thou art not yet fiftie yeeres olde, and hast thou seene Abraham?
\v 58 Iesus said vnto them, Uerely, verely I say vnto you, Before Abraham was, I am.
\v 59 Then tooke they vp stones to cast at him: but Iesus hidde himselfe, and went out of the Temple, going thorow the midst of them, and so passed by.

\iex 1 The man that was borne blinde restored to sight. 8 Hee is brought to the Pharises. 13 They are offended at it, and excommunicate him: 35 But hee is receiued of Iesus, and confesseth him. 39 Who they are whome Christ enlighteneth.
\v 1 ¶ And as Iesus passed by, he saw a man which was blinde from \add his\add* birth.
\v 2 And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sinne, this man, or his parents, that he was borne blinde?
\v 3 Iesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the workes of God should be made manifest in him.
\v 4 I must worke the workes of him that sent me, while it is day: the night commeth when no man can worke.
\v 5 As long as I am in the world, \x + \xo 9:5 \xt Chap. 1.9.\x*I am the light of the world.
\v 6 When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spettle, and he \f + \fr 9:6 \ft Or, spread the clay vpon the eyes of the blinde man.\f*anointed the eyes of the blinde man with the clay,
\v 7 And said vnto him, Goe wash in the poole of Siloam (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therfore, and washed, and came seeing.
\v 8 ¶ The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seene him, that he was blinde, said, Is not this he that sate and begged?
\v 9 Some said, This is hee: others \add said\add*, Hee is like him: \add but\add* hee sayd, I am hee.
\v 10 Therefore said they vnto him, How were thine eyes opened?
\v 11 He answered and said, A man that is called Iesus, made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said vnto me, Goe to the poole of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I receiued sight.
\v 12 Then said they vnto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.
\v 13 ¶ They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.
\v 14 And it was the Sabbath day when Iesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.
\v 15 Then againe the Pharisees also asked him how he had receiued his sight. He said vnto them, Hee put clay vpon mine eyes, and I washed, and doe see.
\v 16 Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because hee keepeth not the Sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner, doe such miracles? and there was a diuision among them.
\v 17 They say vnto the blind man againe, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, Hee is a Prophet.
\v 18 But the Iewes did not beleeue concerning him, that hee had bin blind, and receiued his sight, vntill they called the parents of him that had receiued his sight.
\v 19 And they asked them, saying, Is this your sonne, who ye say was borne blind? how then doth he now see?
\v 20 His parents answered them, and said, We know that this is our sonne, and that he was borne blind:
\v 21 But by what meanes he now seeth, we know not, or who hath opened his eyes we know not: hee is of age, aske him, he shall speake for himselfe.
\v 22 These \add words\add* spake his parents, because they feared the Iewes: for the Iewes had agreed already, that if any man did confesse that he was Christ, he should be put out of the Synagogue.
\v 23 Therefore said his parents, He is of age, aske him.
\v 24 Then againe called they the man that was blind, and said vnto him, Giue God the praise, we know that this man is a sinner.
\v 25 He answered, and said, Whether he be a sinner \add or no\add*, I know not: One thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I see.
\v 26 Then saide they to him againe, What did he to thee? How opened hee thine eyes?
\v 27 He answered them, I haue told you already, and ye did not heare: wherfore would you heare \add it\add* againe? Will ye also be his disciples?
\v 28 Then they reuiled him, and said, Thou art his disciple, but we are Moses disciples.
\v 29 Wee know that God spake vnto Moses: \add as for\add* this \add fellow\add*, we knowe not from whence he is.
\v 30 The man answered, and said vnto them, Why herein is a marueilous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and \add yet\add* he hath opened mine eyes.
\v 31 Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man bee a worshipper of God, and doth his will, him he heareth.
\v 32 Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was borne blinde:
\v 33 If this man were not of God, he could doe nothing.
\v 34 They answered, and saide vnto him, Thou wast altogether borne in sinnes, and doest thou teach vs? And they \f + \fr 9:34 \ft Or, excommunicated him.\f*cast him out.
\v 35 Iesus heard that they had cast him out; and when hee had found him, he said vnto him, Doest thou beleeue on the Sonne of God?
\v 36 He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might beleeue on him?
\v 37 And Iesus said vnto him, Thou hast both seene him, and it is he that talketh with thee.
\v 38 And he said, Lord, I beleeue: and he worshipped him.
\v 39 ¶ And Iesus said, For iudgment I am come into this world, that they which see not, might see, and that they which see, might be made blind.
\v 40 And \add some\add* of the Pharisees which were with him, heard these words, and saide vnto him, Are wee blinde also?
\v 41 Iesus saide vnto them, If yee were blind, ye should haue no sinne: but now ye say, We see, therfore your sinne remaineth.

\iex 1 Christ is the doore and the good Shepheard. 19 Diuers opinions of him. 24 He proueth by his workes, that he is Christ the Sonne of God, 39 Escapeth the Iewes, 40 and went againe beyond Iordane, where many beleeued on him.
\v 1 ¶ Uerily, verily I say vnto you, He that entreth not by y\sup e\sup* doore into the sheepefold, but climeth vp some other way, the same is a theefe, and a robber.
\v 2 But hee that entreth in by the doore, is the shepherd of the sheepe.
\v 3 To him the porter openeth, and the sheepe heare his voyce, and he calleth his owne sheepe by name, and leadeth them out.
\v 4 And when he putteth foorth his owne sheepe, he goeth before them, and the sheepe follow him: for they know his voyce.
\v 5 And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him, for they know not the voyce of strangers.
\v 6 This parable spake Iesus vnto them: but they vnderstood not what things they were which he spake vnto them.
\v 7 Then said Iesus vnto them againe, Uerily, verily I say vnto you, I am the doore of the sheepe.
\v 8 All that euer came before me, are theeues and robbers: but the sheepe did not heare them.
\v 9 I am the doore by me if any man enter in, he shall be saued, and shall goe in and out, and find pasture.
\v 10 The theefe commeth not, but for to steale and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might haue life, and that they might haue \add it\add* more abundantly.
\v 11 \x + \xo 10:11 \xt Esai. 40.11. ezech. 34.23.\x*I am the good shepheard: the good shepheard giueth his life for the sheepe.
\v 12 But hee that is an hireling and not the shepheard, whose owne the sheepe are not, seeth the woolfe coming, and leaueth the sheep, and fleeth: and the woolfe catcheth them, and scattereth the sheepe.
\v 13 The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, & careth not for the sheepe.
\v 14 I am the good shepheard, and know my sheepe, and am knowen of mine.
\v 15 As the father knoweth me, euen so know I the father: & I lay downe my life for the sheepe.
\v 16 And other sheepe I haue, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall heare my voyce; \x + \xo 10:16 \xt Esai. 37.22.\x*and there shall be one fold, \add and\add* one shepheard.
\v 17 Therefore doth my father loue me, \x + \xo 10:17 \xt Esay. 53.7,8.\x*because I lay downe my life that I might take it againe.
\v 18 No man taketh it from me, but I lay it downe of my selfe: I haue power to lay it downe, and I haue power to take it againe. \x + \xo 10:18 \xt Acts 2.24.\x*This commandement haue I receiued of my father.
\v 19 ¶ There was a diuision therefore againe among the Iewes for these sayings.
\v 20 And many of them said, He hath a deuill, and is mad, why heare ye him?
\v 21 Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a deuill. Can a deuill open the eyes of the blind?
\v 22 ¶ And it was at Hierusalem the \x + \xo 10:22 \xt 1.Macc. 4.59.\x*feast of the dedication, & it was winter.
\v 23 And Iesus walked in the temple in Solomons porch.
\v 24 Then came the Iewes round about him, and said vnto him, How long doest thou \f + \fr 10:24 \ft Or, hold vs in suspence.\f*make vs to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell vs plainely.
\v 25 Iesus answered them, I told you, and ye beleeued not: the workes that I doe in my Fathers name, they beare witnesse of me.
\v 26 But ye beleeue not, because ye are not of my sheepe, as I said vnto you.
\v 27 My sheepe heare my voyce, and I know them, and they follow me.
\v 28 And I giue vnto them eternall life, and they shall neuer perish, neither shall any \add man\add* plucke them out of my hand.
\v 29 My father which gaue \add them\add* me, is greater then all: and no \add man\add* is able to plucke \add them\add* out of my fathers hand.
\v 30 I and \add my\add* father are one.
\v 31 Then the Iewes tooke vp stones againe to stone him.
\v 32 Iesus answered them, Many good workes haue I shewed you from my Father; for which of those workes doe ye stone me?
\v 33 The Iewes answered him, saying, For a good worke we stone thee not, but for blasphemy, and because that thou, being a man, makest thy selfe God.
\v 34 Iesus answered them, \x + \xo 10:34 \xt Psal. 82.6.\x*Is it not written in your law, I said, ye are gods?
\v 35 If hee called them gods, vnto whom the word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be broken:
\v 36 Say ye of him, whom the father hath sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Sonne of God?
\v 37 If I doe not the workes of my Father, beleeue me not.
\v 38 But if I doe, though yee beleeue not me, beleeue the works: that ye may know and beleeue that the Father \add is\add* in me, and I in him.
\v 39 Therefore they sought againe to take him: but hee escaped out of their hand,
\v 40 And went away againe beyond Iordane, into the place where Iohn at first baptized: and there he abode.
\v 41 And many resorted vnto him, and said, Iohn did no miracle: but all things that Iohn spake of this man, were true.
\v 42 And many beleeued on him there.

\iex 1 Christ raiseth Lazarus, foure dayes buried. 45 Many Iewes beleeue. 47 The high Priests and Pharisees gather a counsel against Christ. 49 Caiaphas prophecieth. 54 Iesus hid himselfe. 55 At the Passeouer they enquire after him, and lay wait for him.
\v 1 ¶ Now a certaine \add man\add* was sicke, \add named\add* Lazarus of Bethanie, the towne of Mary, and her sister Martha.
\v 2 (\x + \xo 11:2 \xt Matt. 26.7.\x*It was \add that\add* Mary which anoynted the Lord with oyntment, and wiped his feete with her haire, whose brother Lazarus was sicke.)
\v 3 Therefore his sister sent vnto him, saying, Lord, behold, hee whom thou louest, is sicke.
\v 4 When Iesus heard \add that\add*, hee said, This sicknesse is not vnto death, but for the glory of God, that the Sonne of God might be glorified thereby.
\v 5 Now Iesus loued Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
\v 6 When he had heard therefore that he was sicke, he abode two dayes still in the same place where he was.
\v 7 Then after that, saith hee to \add his\add* disciples, Let vs go into Iudea againe.
\v 8 \add His\add* disciples say vnto him, Master, the Iewes of late sought to stone thee, and goest thou thither againe?
\v 9 Iesus answered, Are there not twelue houres in the day? If any man walke in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.
\v 10 But if a man walke in the night, hee stumbleth, because there is no light in him.
\v 11 These things said hee, and after that, hee saith vnto them, Our friend Lazarus sleepeth, but I goe, that I may awake him out of sleepe.
\v 12 Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleepe, he shall doe well.
\v 13 Howbeit Iesus spake of his death: but they thought that hee had spoken of taking of rest in sleepe.
\v 14 Then saide Iesus vnto them plainly, Lazarus is dead:
\v 15 And I am glad for your sakes, that I was not there (to the intent yee may beleeue:) Neuerthelesse, let vs goe vnto him.
\v 16 Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, vnto his fellow disciples, Let vs also goe, that we may die with him.
\v 17 Then when Iesus came, hee found that hee had lien in the graue foure dayes already.
\v 18 (Now Bethanie was nigh vnto Hierusalem, \f + \fr 11:18 \ft That is, about two mile.\f*about fifteene furlongs off:)
\v 19 And many of the Iewes came to Martha, and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.
\v 20 Then Martha, as soone as shee heard that Iesus was comming, went and met him: but Mary sate \add still\add* in the house.
\v 21 Then saide Martha vnto Iesus, Lord, if thou hadst bene here, my brother had not died.
\v 22 But I know, that euen now, whatsoeuer thou wilt aske of God, God will giue \add it\add* thee.
\v 23 Iesus saith vnto her, Thy brother shall rise againe.
\v 24 Martha sayeth vnto him, \x + \xo 11:24 \xt Luke 14.14. chap. 5.29.\x*I know that he shall rise againe in the resurrection at the last day.
\v 25 Iesus said vnto her, I am the resurrection, and the \x + \xo 11:25 \xt Chap. 6.35.\x*life: hee that beleeueth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he liue.
\v 26 And whosoeuer liueth, and beleeueth in mee, shall neuer die. Beleeuest thou this?
\v 27 She saith vnto him, Yea Lord, I beleeue that thou art the Christ the Sonne of God, which should come into the world.
\v 28 And when shee had so said, shee went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.
\v 29 Assoone as she heard \add that\add*, she arose quickely, and came vnto him.
\v 30 Now Iesus was not yet come into the towne, but was in that place where Martha met him.
\v 31 The Iewes then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary that she rose vp hastily, and went out, followed her, saying, Shee goeth vnto the graue, to weepe there.
\v 32 Then when Mary was come where Iesus was, and saw him, shee fell downe at his feete, saying vnto him, Lord, if thou hadst beene here, my brother had not dyed.
\v 33 When Iesus therefore sawe her weeping, and the Iewes also weeping which came with her, hee groned in the Spirit, and \f + \fr 11:33 \ft Gr. Hee troubled himselfe.\f*was troubled,
\v 34 And said, Where haue ye laid him? They say vnto him, Lord, come, & see.
\v 35 Iesus wept.
\v 36 Then said the Iewes, Behold, how he loued him.
\v 37 And some of them said, Could not this man, \x + \xo 11:37 \xt Chap. 9.6.\x*which opened the eyes of the blinde, haue caused that euen this man should not haue died?
\v 38 Iesus therefore againe groning in himselfe, commeth to the graue. It was a caue, and a stone lay vpon it.
\v 39 Iesus said, Take yee away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, sayth vnto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath beene \add dead\add* foure dayes.
\v 40 Iesus saith vnto her, Said I not vnto thee, that if thou wouldst beleeue, thou shouldest see the glory of God?
\v 41 Then they tooke away the stone \add from the place\add* where the dead was laid. And Iesus lift vp \add his\add* eyes, and said, Father, I thanke thee, that thou hast heard me.
\v 42 And I knewe that thou hearest me alwayes: but because of the people which stand by, I said \add it\add*, that they may beleeue that thou hast sent me.
\v 43 And when hee thus had spoken, he cryed with a loude voice, Lazarus, come foorth.
\v 44 And he that was dead, came forth, bound hand & foot with graue-clothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Iesus saith vnto them, Loose him, and let him goe.
\v 45 Then many of the Iewes which came to Mary, and had seene the things which Iesus did, beleeued on him.
\v 46 But some of them went their wayes to the Pharises, and tolde them what things Iesus had done.
\v 47 ¶ Then gathered y\sup e\sup* chiefe Priests and the Pharises a councell, and said, What doe wee? for this man doeth many miracles.
\v 48 If we let him thus alone, all \add men\add* will beleeue on him, and the Romanes shall come, and take away both our place and nation.
\v 49 And one of them \add named\add* Caiaphas, being the high Priest that same yeere, said vnto them, Ye know nothing at all,
\v 50 \x + \xo 11:50 \xt Chap. 18.14.\x*Nor consider that it is expedient for vs, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.
\v 51 And this spake he not of himselfe: but being high Priest that yeere, he prophecied that Iesus should die for that nation:
\v 52 And not for that nation only, but that also hee should gather together in one, the children of God that were scattered abroad.
\v 53 Then from that day foorth, they tooke counsell together for to put him to death.
\v 54 Iesus therefore walked no more openly among the Iewes: but went thence vnto a countrey neere to the wildernesse, into a city called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.
\v 55 ¶ And the Iewes Passeouer was nigh at hand, and many went out of the countrey vp to Hierusalem before the Passeouer to purifie themselues.
\v 56 Then sought they for Iesus, and spake among themselues, as they stood in the Temple, What thinke ye, that he will not come to the feast?
\v 57 Now both the chiefe Priests and the Pharises had giuen a commandement, that if any man knew where hee were, he should shew \add it\add*, that they might take him.
\c 12
\iex 1 Iesus excuseth Mary anointing his feet. 9 The people flocke to see Lazarus. 10 The high Priests consult to kill him. 12 Christ rideth into Ierusalem. 20 Greekes desire to see Iesus. 23 He foretelleth his death. 37 The Iewes are generally blinded: 42 yet many chiefe rulers beleeue, but do not confesse him: 44 therfore Iesus calleth earnestly for confession of faith.
\v 1 ¶ Then Iesus, sixe dayes before the Passouer, came to Bethanie, where Lazarus was, which had bene dead, whom hee raised from the dead.
\v 2 There they made him a supper, and Martha serued: but Lazarus was one of them y\sup t\sup* sate at the table with him.
\v 3 Then tooke Mary a pound of ointment, of Spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Iesus, & wiped his feet with her haire: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.
\v 4 Then saith one of his disciples, Iudas Iscariot, Simons sonne, which should betray him,
\v 5 Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and giuen to the poore?
\v 6 \x + \xo 12:6 \xt Cha. 13.29.\x*This he said, not that he cared for the poore: but because hee was a thiefe, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.
\v 7 Then said Iesus, Let her alone, against the day of my burying hath she kept this.
\v 8 For the poore alwayes yee haue with you: but me ye haue not alwayes.
\v 9 Much people of the Iewes therefore knew that he was there: and they came, not for Iesus sake onely, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.
\v 10 ¶ But the chiefe Priests consulted, y\sup t\sup* they might put Lazarus also to death,
\v 11 Because that by reason of him many of the Iewes went away and beleeued on Iesus.
\v 12 ¶ \x + \xo 12:12 \xt Cha. 21.8.\x*On the next day, much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Iesus was comming to Hierusalem,
\v 13 Tooke branches of Palme trees, and went foorth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna, blessed is the king of Israel that cōmeth in the Name of the Lord.
\v 14 And Iesus, when he had found a yong asse, sate thereon, as it is written,
\v 15 \x + \xo 12:15 \xt Zach. 9.9.\x*Feare not, daughter of Sion, behold, thy King commeth, sitting on an asses colt.
\v 16 These things vnderstood not his disciples at the first: but when Iesus was glorified, then remēbred they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things vnto him.
\v 17 The people therefore that was with him, when he called Lazarus out of his graue, and raised him from the dead, bare record.
\v 18 For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that hee had done this miracle.
\v 19 The Pharisees therefore saide among themselues, Perceiue ye how yee preuaile nothing? Behold, the world is gone after him.
\v 20 ¶ And there were certaine Greeks among them, that came vp to worship at the feast:
\v 21 The same came therefore to Philip which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Iesus.
\v 22 Philip commeth and telleth Andrew: and againe Andrew and Philip told Iesus.
\v 23 ¶ And Iesus answered them, saying, The houre is come, that the Sonne of man should be glorified.
\v 24 Uerely, verely, I say vnto you, Except a corne of wheat fall into the ground, and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.
\v 25 \x + \xo 12:25 \xt Matth. 10.39.\x*He that loueth his life, shall lose it: and hee that hateth his life in this world, shall keepe it vnto life eternall.
\v 26 If any man serue me, let him follow me, and where I am, there shall also my seruant be: If any man serue me, him will \add my\add* father honour.
\v 27 Now is my soule troubled, and what shall I say? Father, saue me from this houre, but for this cause came I vnto this houre.
\v 28 Father, glorifie thy Name. Then came there a voice from heauen, \add saying\add*, I haue both glorified \add it\add*, and wil glorifie \add it\add* againe.
\v 29 The people therefore that stood by, and heard \add it\add*, said, that it thundered: others said, An Angel spake to him.
\v 30 Iesus answered, and said, This voice came not because of mee, but for your sakes.
\v 31 Now is the iudgement of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
\v 32 And I, if I be lifted vp from the earth, will draw all \add men\add* vnto me.
\v 33 (This hee said, signifying what death he should die)
\v 34 The people answered him, \x + \xo 12:34 \xt Psal. 110.4.\x*We haue heard out of the Law, that Christ abideth for euer: and how sayest thou, The Sonne of man must bee lift vp? Who is this Sonne of man?
\v 35 Then Iesus said vnto them, Yet a little while is the light with you: walke while ye haue the light, lest darkdesse come vpon you: For he that walketh in darkenesse, knoweth not whither he goeth.
\v 36 While ye haue light, beleeue in the light, that ye may bee the children of light. These things spake Iesus, and departed, and did hide himselfe from them.
\v 37 ¶ But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they beleeued not on him:
\v 38 That the saying of Esaias the Prophet might be fulfilled, which hee spake, \x + \xo 12:38 \xt Esai. 53.1. rom. 10.16.\x*Lord, who hath beleeued our report? and to whom hath the arme of the Lord beene reuealed?
\v 39 Therefore they could not beleeue, because that Esaias said againe,
\v 40 \x + \xo 12:40 \xt Mat. 13.14.\x*He hath blinded their eyes, and hardned their heart, that they should not see with \add their\add* eyes, nor vnderstand with \add their\add* heart, and be conuerted, and I should heale them.
\v 41 These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.

\v 43 \x + \xo 12:43 \xt Chap. 5.44.\x*For they loued the praise of men, more then the praise of God.
\v 44 ¶ Iesus cried, and said, He that beleeueth on me, beleeueth not on me, but on him that sent me.
\v 45 And he that seeth me, seeth him that sent me.
\v 46 \x + \xo 12:46 \xt Chap. 3.19.\x*I am come a light into the world, that whosoeuer beleeueth on me, should not abide in darkenesse.

\iex 1 Iesus washeth the disciples feete: exhorteth them to humilitie and charitie. 18 He foretelleth, and discouereth to Iohn by a token that Iudas should betray him: 31 Commandeth them to loue one another, 36 And forewarneth Peter of his deniall.
\v 1 ¶ Now \x + \xo 13:1 \xt Mat. 26.2.\x*before the feast of the Passeouer, when Iesus knew that his houre was come, that he should depart out of this world vnto the Father, hauing loued his owne which were in the world, he loued them vnto the end.
\v 2 And supper being ended (the deuill hauing now put into the heart of Iudas Iscariot Simons sonne to betray him.)
\v 3 Iesus knowing that the Father had giuen all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God:
\v 4 He riseth from supper, and layed aside his garments, and tooke a towell, and girded himselfe.
\v 5 After that, he powreth water into a bason, and beganne to wash the disciples feete, and to wipe \add them\add* with the towell wherewith he was girded.
\v 6 Then commeth he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith vnto him, Lord, doest thou wash my feete?
\v 7 Iesus answered, and said vnto him, What I doe, thou knowest not now: but thou shalt know heereafter.
\v 8 Peter saith vnto him, Thou shalt neuer wash my feete. Iesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.
\v 9 Simon Peter saith vnto him, Lord, not my feete only, but also \add my\add* hands, and \add my\add* head.
\v 10 Iesus saith to him, He that is washed, needeth not, saue to wash \add his\add* feet, but is cleane euery whit: and ye are cleane, but not all.
\v 11 For he knew who should betray him, therefore said he, Ye are not all cleane.
\v 12 So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set downe againe, he said vnto them, Know ye what I haue done to you?
\v 13 Ye call me Master and Lord, and ye say well: for \add so\add* I am.
\v 14 If I then \add your\add* Lord and Master haue washed your feete, yee also ought to wash one anothers feete.
\v 15 For I haue giuen you an example, that yee should doe, as I haue done to you.
\v 16 \x + \xo 13:16 \xt Matth. 10.24. chap. 15.20.\x*Uerily, verily I say vnto you, the seruant is not greater then his lord, neither he that is sent, greater then hee that sent him.
\v 17 If yee know these things, happy are ye if ye doe them.
\v 18 ¶ I speake not of you all, I know whom I haue chosen: but that the Scripture may be fulfilled, \x + \xo 13:18 \xt Psal. 41.10.\x*He that eateth bread with mee, hath lift vp his heele against me.

\v 21 \x + \xo 13:21 \xt Matth. 26.21.\x*When Iesus had thus sayd, hee was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Uerily, verily I say vnto you, that one of you shall betray me.
\v 22 Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom hee spake.
\v 23 Now there was leaning on Iesus bosome one of his disciples, whom Iesus loued.
\v 24 Simon Peter therefore beckened to him, that he should aske who it should be of whom he spake.
\v 25 Hee then lying on Iesus breast, saith vnto him, Lord, who is it?
\v 26 Iesus answered, Hee it is to whom I shall giue a \f + \fr 13:26 \ft Or, morsell.\f*soppe, when I haue dipped \add it\add*. And when he had dipped the sop, he gaue \add it\add* to Iudas Iscariot \add the sonne\add* of Simon.
\v 27 And after the soppe, Satan entred into him, Then said Iesus vnto him, That thou doest, doe quickly.
\v 28 Now no man at the table knew, for what intent he spake this vnto him.
\v 29 For some \add of them\add* thought, because Iudas had the bagge, that Iesus had sayd vnto him, Buy \add those things\add* that wee haue need of against the feast: or that he should giue some thing to the poore.
\v 30 He then hauing receiued the sop, went immediatly out: and it was night.
\v 31 ¶ Therefore when hee was gone out, Iesus sayd, Now is the Sonne of man glorified: and God is glorified in him.
\v 32 If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorifie him in himselfe, and shall straightway glorifie him.
\v 33 Litle children, yet a litle while I am with you. Ye shall seeke mee, \x + \xo 13:33 \xt Chap. 7.34.\x*and as I said vnto the Iewes, whither I go, ye cannot come: so now I say to you.

\v 35 By this shall all \add men\add* know that ye are my disciples, if yee haue loue one to another.
\v 36 ¶ Simon Peter sayd vnto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Iesus answered him, Whither I goe, thou canst not follow me now: but thou shalt follow me afterwards.
\v 37 Peter said vnto him, Lord, why can not I follow thee now? I will \x + \xo 13:37 \xt Matt. 26.33.\x*lay downe my life for thy sake.

\v 5 Thomas saith vnto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest: and how can we know the way?

\v 21 He that hath my commandements, and keepeth them, hee it is that loueth me: and he that loueth me shall be loued of my Father, and I will loue him, and will manifest my selfe to him.
\v 22 Iudas saith vnto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thy selfe vnto vs, and not vnto the world?
\v 23 Iesus answered, and saide vnto him, If a man loue mee, he will keepe my wordes: and my Father will loue him, and wee will come vnto him, and make our abode with him.
\v 24 He that loueth mee not, keepeth not my sayings, and the word which you heare, is not mine, but the Fathers which sent mee.

\v 8 Herein is my Father glorified, that ye beare much fruit, so shall ye bee my Disciples.
\v 9 As the Father hath loued me, so haue I loued you: continue ye in my loue.
\v 10 If ye keepe my Commandements, ye shal abide in my loue, euen as I haue kept my Fathers Commandements, and abide in his loue.

\v 14 Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoeuer I command you.
\v 15 Henceforth I call you not seruants, for the seruant knoweth not what his lord doth, but I haue called you friends: for all things that I haue heard of my Father, I haue made knowen vnto you.
\v 16 Ye haue not chosen me, but I haue chosen you, and \x + \xo 15:16 \xt Mat. 28.19\x*ordeined you, that you should goe and bring foorth fruit, and \add that\add* your fruite should remaine: that whatsoeuer ye shall aske of the Father in my Name, he may giue it you.

\v 20 Uerily, verily I say vnto you, that ye shall weepe and lament, but the world shall reioyce: And ye shall be sorrowfull, but your sorrow shall be turned into ioy.

\iex 1 Iudas betrayeth Iesus. 6 The Officers fall to the ground. 10 Peter smiteth off Malchus eare. 12 Iesus is taken, and led vnto Annas and Caiaphas. 15 Peters deniall. 19 Iesus examined before Caiaphas. 28 His arraignment before Pilate. 36 His Kingdome. 40 The Iewes aske Barabbas to be let loose.
\v 1 ¶ When Iesus had spoken these wordes, \x + \xo 18:1 \xt Matth. 26.36.\x*hee went foorth with his disciples ouer the Brooke Cedron, where was a garden, into the which hee entred and his disciples.
\v 2 And Iudas also which betrayed him, knew the place: for Iesus oft times resorted thither with his disciples.
\v 3 \x + \xo 18:3 \xt Matth. 26.47.\x*Iudas then hauing receiued a band \add of men\add*, and officers from the chiefe Priests and Pharisees, commeth thither with lanternes and torches, and weapons.
\v 4 Iesus therefore knowing all things that should come vpon him, went foorth, and sayde vnto them, Whom seeke ye?
\v 5 They answered him, Iesus of Nazareth. Iesus saith vnto them, I am hee. And Iudas also which betraied him, stood with them.
\v 6 Assoone then as he had said vnto them, I am \add he\add*, they went backeward, and fell to the ground.
\v 7 Then asked hee them againe, Whom seeke ye? And they said, Iesus of Nazareth.
\v 8 Iesus answered, I haue tolde you that I am \add he\add*: If therefore ye seeke me, let these goe their way:
\v 9 That the saying might be fulfilled which he spake, \x + \xo 18:9 \xt Chap. 17.12.\x*Of them which thou gauest me, haue I lost none.
\v 10 Then Simon Peter hauing a sword, drewe it, and smote the high Priests seruant, & cut off his right eare: The seruants name was Malchus.
\v 11 Then said Iesus vnto Peter, Put vp thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my father hath giuen me, shall I not drinke it?
\v 12 Then the band and the captaine, and officers of the Iewes, tooke Iesus, and bound him,
\v 13 And led him away to Annas first, (for he was father in law to Caiaphas) which was the high Priest that same yeere.\f + \fr 18:13 \ft And Annas sent Christ bound vnto Caiaphas the high Priest, \xt ver. 24.\f*
\v 14 \x + \xo 18:14 \xt Chap. 11.50.\x*Now Caiaphas was he which gaue counsell to the Iewes, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
\v 15 ¶ \x + \xo 18:15 \xt Mat. 26.58.\x*And Simon Peter followed Iesus, and \add so did\add* another disciple: that disciple was knowen vnto the high Priest, and went in with Iesus into the palace of the high Priest.
\v 16 But Peter stood at the doore without. Then went out that other disciple, which was knowen vnto the high Priest, and spake vnto her that kept the doore, and brought in Peter.
\v 17 Then saith the damosell that kept the doore vnto Peter, Art not thou also \add one\add* of this mans disciples? He sayth, I am not.
\v 18 And the seruants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coales, (for it was colde) and they warmed themselues: and Peter stood with them, and warmed himselfe.
\v 19 ¶ The high Priest then asked Iesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.
\v 20 Iesus answered him, I spake openly to the world, I euer taught in the Synagogue, and in the Temple, whither the Iewes alwayes resort, and in secret haue I said nothing:
\v 21 Why askest thou me? Aske them which heard me, what I haue said vnto them: behold, they know what I said.
\v 22 And when hee had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by, stroke Iesus \f + \fr 18:22 \ft Or, with a rod.\f*with the palme of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the hie priest so?
\v 23 Iesus answered him, If I haue spoken euill, beare witnesse of the euill: but if well, why smitest thou me?
\v 24 \x + \xo 18:24 \xt Mat. 26.57.\x*Now Annas had sent him bound vnto Caiaphas the high Priest.
\v 25 And Simon Peter stood and warmed himselfe: \x + \xo 18:25 \xt Mat. 26.69.\x*They said therefore vnto him, Art not thou also \add one\add* of his disciples? Hee denied \add it\add*, and said, I am not.
\v 26 One of the seruants of the high Priests (being \add his\add* kinsman whose eare Peter cut off) saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him?
\v 27 Peter then denied againe, and immediatly the cocke crew.
\v 28 ¶ \x + \xo 18:28 \xt Mat. 27.2.\x*Then led they Iesus from Caiaphas vnto \f + \fr 18:28 \ft Or, Pilats house.\f*the hall of Iudgement: And it was earely, \x + \xo 18:28 \xt Acts 10.28.\x*and they themselues went not into the Iudgement hall, lest they should be defiled: but that they might eat the Passeouer.
\v 29 Pilate then went out vnto them, and said, What accusation bring you against this man?
\v 30 They answered, & said vnto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not haue deliuered him vp vnto thee.
\v 31 Then saide Pilate vnto them, Take ye him, and iudge him according to your law. The Iewes therefore said vnto him, It is not lawfull for vs to put any man to death:
\v 32 \x + \xo 18:32 \xt Mat. 20.19.\x*That the saying of Iesus might be fulfilled, which hee spake, signifying what death he should die.
\v 33 \x + \xo 18:33 \xt Mat. 27.11.\x*Then Pilate entred into the Iudgement hall againe, and called Iesus, and saide vnto him, Art thou the King of the Iewes?
\v 34 Iesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thy selfe? or did others tell it thee of me?
\v 35 Pilate answered, Am I a Iew? Thine owne nation, and the chiefe Priests haue deliuered thee vnto mee: What hast thou done?
\v 36 Iesus answered, My kingdome is not of this world: if my kingdome were of this world, then would my seruants fight, that I should not be deliuered to the Iewes: but now is my kingdome not from hence.
\v 37 Pilate therefore saide vnto him, Art thou a King then? Iesus answered, Thou saiest that I am a King. To this end was I borne, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should beare witnesse vnto the trueth: euery one that is of the trueth heareth my voice.
\v 38 Pilate saith vnto him, What is trueth? And when hee had said this, he went out againe vnto the Iewes, and saith vnto them, I find in him no fault \add at all\add*.
\v 39 \x + \xo 18:39 \xt Matth. 27 15.\x*But yee haue a custome that I should release vnto you one at the Passeouer: will ye therefore that I release vnto you the king of the Iewes?
\v 40 \x + \xo 18:40 \xt Act. 3.14.\x*Then cried they all againe, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.
\c 19
\iex 1 Christ is scourged, crowned with thornes, and beaten. 4 Pilate is desirous to release him, but being ouercome with the outrage of the Iewes, he deliuered him to bee crucified. 23 They cast lots for his garments. 26 He commendeth his mother to Iohn. 28 Hee dieth. 31 His side is pierced. 38 He is buried by Ioseph and Nicodemus.
\v 1 ¶ Then \x + \xo 19:1 \xt Matth. 27.26.\x*Pilate therfore tooke Iesus, and scourged \add him\add*.
\v 2 And the souldiers platted a crowne of thornes, and put \add it\add* on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,
\v 3 And said, Haile king of the Iewes: and they smote him with their hands.
\v 4 Pilate therefore went foorth againe, and saith vnto them, Behold, I bring him foorth to you, that yee may know that I find no fault in him.
\v 5 Then came Iesus forth, wearing the crowne of thornes, and the purple robe: and \add Pilate\add* saith vnto them, Behold the man.
\v 6 When the chiefe Priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucifie \add him\add*, crucifie \add him\add*. Pilate saith vnto them, Take ye \add him\add*, and crucifie him: for I find no fault in him.
\v 7 The Iewes answered him, We haue a law, and by our law he ought to die, because hee made himselfe the Son of God.
\v 8 ¶ When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid,
\v 9 And went againe into the iudgement hall, & saith vnto Iesus, Whence art thou? But Iesus gaue him no answere.
\v 10 Then saith Pilate vnto him, Speakest thou not vnto me? Knowest thou not, that I haue power to crucifie thee, and haue power to release thee?
\v 11 Iesus answered, Thou couldest haue no power \add at all\add* against me, except it were giuen thee from aboue: therfore he that deliuered me vnto thee, hath the greater sinne.
\v 12 And from thencefore Pilate sought to release him: but the Iewes cried out, saying, If thou let this man goe, thou art not Cesars friend: whosoeuer maketh himselfe a king, speaketh against Cesar.
\v 13 ¶ When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Iesus foorth, and sate downe in the iudgement seate, in a place that is called the pauement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.
\v 14 And it was the preparation of the Passeouer, and about the sixt houre: and he saith vnto the Iewes, Beholde your King.
\v 15 But they cried out, Away with \add him\add*, away with \add him\add*, crucifie him. Pilate saith vnto them, Shall I crucifie your King? The chiefe Priests answered, Wee haue no king but Cesar.
\v 16 \x + \xo 19:16 \xt Matth. 27.31.\x*Then deliuered he him therfore vnto them to be crucified: and they took Iesus, and led \add him\add* away.
\v 17 And he bearing his crosse, went foorth into a place called \add the place\add* of a skull, which is called in the Hebrewe, Golgotha:
\v 18 Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Iesus in the middest.
\v 19 ¶ And Pilate wrote a title, and put \add it\add* on the crosse. And the writing was, IESVS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE IEWES.
\v 20 This title then read many of the Iewes: for the place where Iesus was crucified, was nigh to the citie, and it was written in Hebrewe, \add and\add* Greeke, \add and\add* Latine.
\v 21 Then said the chiefe Priests of the Iewes to Pilate, Write not, The king of the Iewes: but that he said, I am King of the Iewes.
\v 22 Pilate answered, What I haue written, I haue written.
\v 23 ¶ \x + \xo 19:23 \xt Matth. 27.35.\x*Then the souldiers, when they had crucified Iesus, tooke his garments, (and made foure parts, to euery souldier a part) and also \add his\add* coat: Now the coate was without seame, \f + \fr 19:23 \ft Or, wrought.\f*wouen from the top thorowout.
\v 24 They said therefore among themselues, Let not vs rent it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall bee: \x + \xo 19:24 \xt Psal. 22.18\x*that the Scripture might bee fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the souldiers did.
\v 25 ¶ Now there stood by the crosse of Iesus, his mother, and his mothers sister, Mary the \add wife\add* of \f + \fr 19:25 \ft Or, Clopas.\f*Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.
\v 26 When Iesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loued, he saith vnto his mother, Woman, behold thy sonne.
\v 27 Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother. And from that houre that disciple tooke her vnto his owne \add home\add*.
\v 28 ¶ After this, Iesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, \x + \xo 19:28 \xt Psal. 69.12.\x*that the Scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.
\v 29 Now there was set a vessell, full of vineger: And they filled a spunge with vineger, and put \add it\add* vpon hyssope, and put \add it\add* to his mouth.
\v 30 When Iesus therefore had receiued the vineger, he said, It is finished, and he bowed his head, and gaue vp the ghost.
\v 31 The Iewes therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remaine vpon the Crosse on the Sabbath day (for that Sabbath day was an high day) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and \add that\add* they might be taken away.
\v 32 Then came the souldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other, which was crucified with him.
\v 33 But when they came to Iesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs.
\v 34 But one of the souldiers with a speare pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water.
\v 35 And he that saw \add it\add*, bare record, and his record is true, and he knoweth that hee saith true, that yee might beleeue.
\v 36 For these things were done, \x + \xo 19:36 \xt Num. 9.12. exod. 12.46.\x*that the Scripture should be fulfilled, \x + \xo 19:36 \xt Psa. 34.21\x*A bone of him shall not be broken.
\v 37 \x + \xo 19:37 \xt Zach. 12.10.\x*And againe another Scripture saith, They shall looke on him whom they piersed.
\v 38 ¶ \x + \xo 19:38 \xt Mat. 27.57.\x*And after this, Ioseph of Arimathea (being a disciple of Iesus, but secretly for feare of the Iewes) besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Iesus, and Pilate gaue \add him\add* leaue: he came therefore, and tooke the body of Iesus.
\v 39 And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to Iesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrhe and aloes, about an hundred pound \add weight\add*.
\v 40 Then tooke they the body of Iesus, & wound it in linnen clothes, with the spices, as the maner of the Iewes is to burie:
\v 41 Now in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new Sepulchre, wherein was neuer man yet layd.
\v 42 There laid they Iesus therefore, because of the Iewes preparation \add day\add*, for the Sepulchre was nigh at hand.
\c 20
\iex 1 Mary commeth to the Sepulchre. 3 So doe Peter and Iohn ignorant of the Resurrection. 11 Iesus appeareth to Mary Magdalene, 19 And to his Disciples. 24 The incredulitie, and confession of Thomas. 30 The Scripture is sufficient to saluation.
\v 1 ¶ \x + \xo 20:1 \xt Mat. 28.1. mark. 16.1.\x*The first \add day\add* of the weeke, commeth Mary Magdalene earely when it was yet darke, vnto the Sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the Sepulchre.
\v 2 Then she runneth and commeth to Simon Peter, and to the \x + \xo 20:2 \xt Chap. 13.23. and 21.20.\x*other disciple whom Iesus loued, and saith vnto them, They haue taken away the Lord out of the Sepulchre, and we know not where they haue laid him.
\v 3 Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the Sepulchre.
\v 4 So they ranne both together, and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the Sepulchre.
\v 5 And he stouping downe \add and looking in\add*, saw the linnen clothes lying, yet went he not in.
\v 6 Then commeth Simon Peter following him, and went into the Sepulchre, and seeth the linnen clothes lie,
\v 7 And the napkin that was about his head, not lying with the linnen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by it selfe.
\v 8 Then went in also that other disciple which came first to the Sepulchre, and he saw, and beleeued.
\v 9 For as yet they knew not the Scripture, that hee must rise againe from the dead.
\v 10 Then the disciples went away againe vnto their owne home.
\v 11 ¶ But Mary stood without at the sepulchre, weeping: & as shee wept, she stouped downe, \add and looked\add* into the Sepulchre,
\v 12 And seeth two Angels in white, sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feete, where the body of Iesus had layen:
\v 13 And they say vnto her, Woman, why weepest thou? Shee saith vnto them, Because they haue taken away my Lord, and I know not where they haue laied him.
\v 14 And when she had thus said, she turned herselfe backe, and saw Iesus standing, and knew not that it was Iesus.
\v 15 Iesus saith vnto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She supposing him to be the gardiner, saith vnto him, Sir, if thou haue borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laied him, and I will take him away.
\v 16 Iesus saith vnto her, Mary. She turned herselfe, and saith vnto him, Rabboni, which is to say, Master.
\v 17 Iesus saith vnto her, Touch me not: for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but goe to my brethren, and say vnto them, I ascend vnto my Father, and your Father, and \add to\add* my God, and your God.
\v 18 Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that shee had seene the Lord, and \add that\add* hee had spoken these things vnto her.
\v 19 ¶ \x + \xo 20:19 \xt Marke 16.14.\x*Then the same day at euening, being the first \add day\add* of the weeke, when the doores were shut, where the disciples were assembled for feare of the Iewes, came Iesus, and stood in the midst, and saith vnto them, Peace \add bee\add* vnto you.
\v 20 And when hee had so saide, hee shewed vnto them \add his\add* hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.
\v 21 Then said Iesus to them againe, Peace \add be\add* vnto you: As \add my\add* Father hath sent me, euen so send I you.
\v 22 And when he had said this, hee breathed on \add them\add*, and saith vnto them, Receiue ye the holy Ghost.
\v 23 \x + \xo 20:23 \xt Matth. 18.18.\x*Whose soeuer sinnes yee remit, they are remitted vnto them, \add and\add* whose soeuer sinnes yee retaine, they are retained.
\v 24 ¶ But Thomas one of the twelue, called Didymus, was not with them when Iesus came.
\v 25 The other disciples therefore said vnto him, We haue seene the Lord. But he said vnto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nailes, and put my finger into the print of the nailes, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not beleeue.
\v 26 ¶ And after eight dayes, againe his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: \add Then\add* came Iesus, the doores being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace \add be\add* vnto you.
\v 27 Then saith he to Thomas Reach hither thy finger, and beholde my hands, and reach hither thy hand, and thrust \add it\add* into my side, and bee not faithlesse, but beleeuing.
\v 28 And Thomas answered, and said vnto him, My Lord, and my God.
\v 29 Iesus saith vnto him, Thomas, because thou hast seene mee, thou hast beleeued: blessed \add are\add* they that haue not seene, and \add yet\add* haue beleeued.
\v 30 ¶ \x + \xo 20:30 \xt Chap. 21.25.\x*And many other signes truely did Iesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this booke:
\v 31 But these are written, that yee might beleeue that Iesus is the Christ the Sonne of God, and that beleeuing ye might haue life through his Name.
\c 21
\iex 1 Christ appearing againe to his disciples was knowen of them by the great draught of fishes. 12 Hee dineth with them: 15 earnestly commandeth Peter to feed his Lambes and sheepe: 18 Foretelleth him of his death: 22 Rebuketh his curiositie touching Iohn. 25 The conclusion.
\v 1 ¶ After these things Iesus shewed \add himselfe\add* againe to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias, and on this wise shewed he \add himselfe\add*.
\v 2 There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathaneel of Cana in Galilee, and the sonnes of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.
\v 3 Simon Peter saith vnto them, I goe a fishing. They say vnto him, Wee also goe with thee. They went foorth and entred into a ship immediatly, and that night they caught nothing.
\v 4 But when the morning was now come, Iesus stood on the shore: but the disciples knewe not that it was Iesus.
\v 5 Then Iesus saith vnto them, \f + \fr 21:5 \ft Or, Sirs.\f*Children, haue ye any meat? They answered him, No.
\v 6 And he said vnto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and yee shall finde. They cast therfore, and now they were not able to draw it, for the multitude of fishes.
\v 7 Therefore that Disciple whome Iesus loued, saith vnto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt \add his\add* fishers coate \add vnto him\add*, (for hee was naked) & did cast himselfe into the sea.
\v 8 And the other disciples came in a litle ship (for they were not farre from land, but as it were two hundred cubites) dragging the net with fishes.
\v 9 Assoone then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coales there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.
\v 10 Iesus saith vnto them, Bring of the fish, which ye haue now caught.
\v 11 Simon Peter went vp, & drewe the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fiftie and three: and for all there were so many, yet was not the net broken.
\v 12 Iesus saith vnto them, Come, \add and\add* dine. And none of the disciples durst aske him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.
\v 13 Iesus then commeth, and taketh bread, and giueth them, and fish likewise.
\v 14 This is nowe the third time that Iesus shewed himselfe to his disciples, after that hee was risen from the dead.
\v 15 ¶ So when they had dined, Iesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, sonne of Ionas, louest thou mee more then these? He saith vnto him, Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I loue thee. He saith vnto him, Feed my lambes.
\v 16 He saith to him againe the second time, Simon sonne of Ionas, louest thou me? He saith vnto him, Yea Lord, thou knowest that I loue thee. He saith vnto him, Feed my sheepe.
\v 17 He said vnto him the third time, Simon sonne of Ionas, louest thou mee? Peter was grieued, because hee saide vnto him the third time, Louest thou me? And he said vnto him, Lord, thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I loue thee. Iesus sayth vnto him, Feed my sheepe.
\v 18 Uerily, verily I say vnto thee, whē thou wast yong, thou girdedst thy selfe, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carie thee whither thou wouldest not.
\v 19 This spake hee, signifying by what death he should glorifie God. And when he had spoken this, he sayth vnto him, Follow me.
\v 20 Then Peter turning about, seeth the Disciple \x + \xo 21:20 \xt Iohn. 13.23. & 20.2.\x*whom Iesus loued, following, which also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is hee that betraieth thee?
\v 21 Peter seeing him, saith to Iesus, Lord, and what \add shall\add* this man doe?
\v 22 Iesus saith vnto him, If I will that he tary till I come, what \add is that\add* to thee? Follow thou me.
\v 23 Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that Disciple should not die: yet Iesus sayd not vnto him, He shall not die: but, If I will that he tary till I come, what \add is that\add* to thee?
\v 24 This is the Disciple which testifieth of these things, and wrote these things, and we know that his testimonie is true.
\v 25 \x + \xo 21:25 \xt Chap. 20.30.\x*And there are also many other things which Iesus did, the which if they should be written euery one, I suppose that euen the world it selfe could not conteine the bookes that should be written, Amen.
