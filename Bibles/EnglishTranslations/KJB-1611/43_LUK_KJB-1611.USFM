\v 1 ¶ Forasmuch as many haue taken in hande to set foorth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely beleeued among vs,
\v 2 Euen as they deliuered them vnto vs, which from the beginning were eye-witnesses, & ministers of the word:
\v 3 It seemed good to me also, hauing had perfect vnderstanding of things from the very first, to write vnto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,
\v 4 That thou mightest know the certainetie of those things wherein thou hast bene instructed.
\v 5 ¶ There was in the dayes of Herode the king of Iudea, a certaine Priest, named Zacharias, of the course of Abia, and his wife \add was\add* of the daughters of Aaron, and her name \add was\add* Elizabeth.
\v 6 And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the Commandements and ordinances of the Lord, blamelesse.
\v 7 And they had no childe, because that Elizabeth was barren, and they both were \add now\add* well striken in yeeres.
\v 8 And it came to passe, that while he executed the Priests office before God in the order of his course,
\v 9 According to the custome of the Priests office, his lot was to burne incense when he went into the Temple of the Lord.
\v 10 \x + \xo 1:10 \xt Exo. 30.7. leuit. 16.17\x*And the whole multitude of the people were praying without, at the time of incense.
\v 11 And there appeared vnto him an Angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the Altar of incense.
\v 12 And when Zacharias sawe \add him\add*, hee was troubled, and feare fell vpon him.
\v 13 But the Angel said vnto him, Feare not, Zacharias, for thy prayer is heard, and thy wife Elizabeth shall beare thee a sonne, and thou shalt call his name Iohn.
\v 14 And thou shalt haue ioy and gladnesse, and many shall reioyce at his birth:
\v 15 For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shal drinke neither wine, nor strong drinke, and he shall bee filled with the holy Ghost, euen from his mothers wombe.
\v 16 \x + \xo 1:16 \xt Malac. 4.6\x*And many of the children of Israel shall hee turne to the Lord their God.
\v 17 And hee shall goe before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turne the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient \f + \fr 1:17 \ft Or, by.\f*to the wisedome of the iust, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.
\v 18 And Zacharias said vnto the Angel, Whereby shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife well striken in yeeres.
\v 19 And the Angel answering, said vnto him, I am Gabriel that stand in the presence of God, and am sent to speake vnto thee, and to shew thee these glad tidings.
\v 20 And behold, thou shalt be dumbe, and not able to speake, vntill the day that these things shall bee performed, because thou beleeuest not my words, which shall bee fulfilled in their season.
\v 21 And the people waited for Zacharias, and maruelled that hee taried so long in the temple.
\v 22 And when he came out, he could not speake vnto them: and they perceiued that he had seene a vision in the temple: for he beckened vnto them, and remained speechlesse.
\v 23 And it came to passe, that as soone as the dayes of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his owne house.
\v 24 And after those dayes his wife Elizabeth conceiued, and hid her selfe fiue moneths, saying,
\v 25 Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the dayes wherein he looked on \add me\add*, to take away my reproch among men.
\v 26 And in the sixt moneth, the Angel Gabriel was sent from God, vnto a citie of Galilee, named Nazareth,
\v 27 To a virgine espoused to a man whose name was Ioseph, of the house of Dauid, and the virgins name \add was\add* Marie.
\v 28 And the Angel came in vnto her, and said, Haile \add thou that art\add* \f + \fr 1:28 \ft Or, graciously accepted, or much graced, see verse 30.\f*highly fauoured, the Lord \add is\add* with thee: Blessed \add art\add* thou among women.
\v 29 And when she saw \add him\add*, she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her minde what maner of salutation this should be.
\v 30 And the Angel said vnto her, Feare not, Marie, for thou hast found fauour with God.
\v 31 \x + \xo 1:31 \xt Esai. 7.14. mat. 1.21.\x*And behold, thou shalt conceiue in thy wombe, and bring forth a sonne, and shalt call his name Iesus.
\v 32 He shall be great, and shall be called the sonne of the Highest, and the Lord God shall giue vnto him the throne of his father Dauid.
\v 33 \x + \xo 1:33 \xt Dan. 7.14. mich. 4.7.\x*And hee shall reigne ouer the house of Iacob for euer, and of his kingdome there shall be no end.
\v 34 Then said Marie vnto the Angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?
\v 35 And the Angel answered and said vnto her, The holy Ghost shall come vpon thee, and the power of the Highest shall ouershadow thee. Therefore also that holy thing which shall bee borne of thee, shall bee called the sonne of God.
\v 36 And behold, thy cousin Elizabeth, she hath also conceiued a sonne in her old age, and this is the sixt moneth with her, who was called barren.
\v 37 For with God no thing shall be vnpossible.
\v 38 And Marie said, Behold the handmaide of the Lord, be it vnto me according to thy word: and the Angel departed from her.
\v 39 And Marie arose in those dayes, and went into the hill countrey with haste, into a citie of Iuda,
\v 40 And entred into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elizabeth.
\v 41 And it came to passe that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Marie, the babe leaped in her wombe, and Elizabeth was filled with the holy Ghost.
\v 42 And she spake out with a loud voyce, and saide, Blessed \add art\add* thou among women, and blessed \add is\add* the fruite of thy wombe.
\v 43 And whence \add is\add* this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to mee?
\v 44 For loe, assoone as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine eares, the babe leaped in my wombe for ioy.
\v 45 And blessed \add is\add* she \f + \fr 1:45 \ft Or, which beleeued, that there.\f*that beleeued, for there shalbe a performance of those things, which were told her from the Lord.
\v 46 And Marie said, My soule doth magnifie the Lord.
\v 47 And my spirit hath reioyced in God my sauiour.
\v 48 For hee hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for behold, from hencefoorth all generations shall call me blessed.
\v 49 For he that is mighty hath done to mee great things, and holy \add is\add* his Name.
\v 50 And his mercy \add is\add* on them that feare him, from generation to generation.
\v 51 \x + \xo 1:51 \xt Esay 51.9.\x*Hee hath shewed strength with his arme, \x + \xo 1:51 \xt Psal. 33.10.\x*he hath scattered the proud, in the imagination of their hearts.
\v 52 \x + \xo 1:52 \xt 1.Sam. 2.6.\x*He hath put downe the mighty from \add their\add* seates, and exalted them of low degree.
\v 53 \x + \xo 1:53 \xt Psal. 34.10.\x*Hee hath filled the hungry with good things, and the rich hee hath sent emptie away.
\v 54 Hee hath holpen his seruant Israel, \x + \xo 1:54 \xt Iere. 31.3,20.\x*in remembrance of \add his\add* mercy,
\v 55 \x + \xo 1:55 \xt Psal. 132.10. gen. 17 19.\x*As he spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for euer.
\v 56 And Mary abode with her about three moneths, and returned to her owne house.
\v 57 Now Elizabeths full time came, that shee should be deliuered, and shee brought foorth a sonne.
\v 58 And her neighbours and her cousins heard how the Lord had shewed great mercy vpon her, and they reioyced with her.
\v 59 And it came to passe that on the eight day they came to circumcise the childe, and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.
\v 60 And his mother answered, and said, Not \add so\add*, but he shalbe called Iohn.
\v 61 And they said vnto her, There is none of thy kinred that is called by this name.
\v 62 And they made signes to his father, how he would haue him called.
\v 63 And he asked for a writing table, and wrote, saying, His name is Iohn: and they marueiled all.
\v 64 And his mouth was opened immediatly, and his tongue \add loosed\add*, and hee spake, and praised God.
\v 65 And feare came on all that dwelt round about them, and all these \f + \fr 1:65 \ft Or, things.\f*sayings were noised abroad thorowout all the hill countrey of Iudea.
\v 66 And all they that had heard \add them\add*, layde \add them\add* vp in their hearts, saying, What maner of childe shal this be? And the hand of the Lord was with him.
\v 67 And his father Zacharias was filled with the holy Ghost, and prophesied, saying,
\v 68 Blessed \add bee\add* the Lord God of Israel, for hee hath visited and redeemed his people,
\v 69 \x + \xo 1:69 \xt Psal. 132.18.\x*And hath raised vp an horne of saluation for vs, in the house of his seruant Dauid,
\v 70 \x + \xo 1:70 \xt Iere. 23.5. and 30.9.\x*As he spake by the mouth of his holy Prophets, which haue bene since the world began:
\v 71 That wee should be saued from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate vs,
\v 72 To performe the mercy \add promised\add* to our fathers, and to remember his holy Couenant,
\v 73 \x + \xo 1:73 \xt Gene. 22.16.\x*The oath which he sware to our father Abraham,
\v 74 That hee would grant vnto vs, that wee beeing deliuered out of the hands of our enemies, might serue him without feare,
\v 75 In holinesse and righteousnesse before him, all the dayes of our life.
\v 76 And thou childe shalt bee called the Prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt goe before the face of the Lord to prepare his wayes.
\v 77 To giue knowledge of saluation vnto his people, \f + \fr 1:77 \ft Or, for.\f*by the remission of their sinnes,
\v 78 Through the \f + \fr 1:78 \ft Or, bowels of the mercy.\f*tender mercy of our God, whereby the \f + \fr 1:78 \ft Or, Sunne-rising, or branch, Zac. 3.8. esay 11.1. malach. 4.2. numb. 24.17.\f*day-spring from on high hath visited vs,
\v 79 To giue light to them that sit in darknes, and \add in\add* the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.
\v 80 And the childe grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts, till the day of his shewing vnto Israel.

\iex 1 Augustus taxeth all the Romane Empire: 6 The natiuitie of Christ: 8 one Angel relateth it to the shepherds: 13 many sing praises to God for it. 21 Christ is circumcised. 22 Mary purified: 28 Simeon and Anna prophecie of Christ: 40 who increaseth in wisdome, 46 questioneth in the Temple with the doctours, 51 and is obedient to his parents.
\v 1 ¶ And it came to passe in those dayes, that there went out a decree from Cesar Augustus, that all the world should be \f + \fr 2:1 \ft Or, inrolled.\f*taxed.
\v 2 (And this taxing was first made whē Cyrenius was gouernor of Syria)
\v 3 And all went to bee taxed, euery one into his owne citie.
\v 4 And Ioseph also wet vp fro Galilee, out of the citie of Nazareth, into Iudea, vnto the \x + \xo 2:4 \xt Iohn 7.42.\x*citie of Dauid, which is called Bethlehem, (because he was of the house and linage of Dauid,)
\v 5 To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.
\v 6 And so it was, that while they were there, the dayes were accomplished that she should be deliuered.
\v 7 And she brought foorth her first borne sonne, and wrapped him in swadling clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no roome for them in the Inne.
\v 8 And there were in the same countrey shepheards abiding in y\sup e\sup* field, keeping \f + \fr 2:8 \ft Or, the night watches.\f*watch ouer their flocke by night.
\v 9 And loe, the Angel of the Lord came vpon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them, and they were sore afraid.
\v 10 And the Angel said vnto them, Feare not: For behold, I bring you good tidings of great ioy, which shall be to all people.
\v 11 For vnto you is borne this day, in the citie of Dauid, a Sauiour, which is Christ the Lord.
\v 12 And this \add shall be\add* a signe vnto you; yee shall find the babe wrapped in swadling clothes lying in a manger.
\v 13 And suddenly there was with the Angel a multitude of the heauenly hoste praising God, and saying,
\v 14 Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good wil towards men.
\v 15 And it came to passe, as the Angels were gone away from them into heauen, the shepheards said one to another, Let vs now goe euen vnto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to passe, which the Lord hath made knowen vnto vs.
\v 16 And they came with haste, and found Mary and Ioseph, and the babe lying in a manger.
\v 17 And when they had seene \add it\add*, they made knowen abroad the saying, which was told them, concerning this child.
\v 18 And all they that heard \add it\add*, wondered at those things, which were tolde them by the shepheards.
\v 19 But Mary kept all these things, and pondered \add them\add* in her heart.
\v 20 And the shepheards returned, glorifying & praising God for all the things that they had heard and seene, as it was told vnto them.
\v 21 \x + \xo 2:21 \xt Gen. 17.12.\x*And when eight dayes were accomplished for the circumcising of the childe, his name was called \x + \xo 2:21 \xt Mat. 1.21.\x*Iesus, which was so named of the Angel before he was conceiued in the wombe.
\v 22 And when the dayes of her purification according to the law of Moses, were accomplished, they brought him to Hierusalem, to present \add him\add* to the Lord,
\v 23 (As it is written in the law of the Lord, \x + \xo 2:23 \xt Exod. 13.2. numb. 18.16.\x*Euery male that openeth the wombe, shalbe called holy to the Lord)
\v 24 And to offer a sacrifice according to \x + \xo 2:24 \xt Leuit. 12.2,6.\x*that which is said in the Law of the Lord, a paire of turtle doues, or two yong pigeons.
\v 25 And behold, there was a man in Hierusalem, whose name \add was\add* Simeon, and the same man \add was\add* iust and deuout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the holy Ghost was vpon him.
\v 26 And it was reuealed vnto him by the holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seene the Lords Christ.
\v 27 And hee came by the spirit into the Temple: and when the parents brought in the child Iesus, to doe for him after the custome of the Lawe,
\v 28 Then tooke hee him vp in his armes, and blessed God, and said,
\v 29 Lord now lettest thou thy seruant depart in peace, according to thy word.
\v 30 For mine eyes haue seene thy saluation.
\v 31 Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people.
\v 32 A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.
\v 33 And Ioseph and his mother marueiled at those things which were spoken of him.
\v 34 And Simeon blessed them, and said vnto Marie his mother, Behold, this \add child\add* is set for the \x + \xo 2:34 \xt Esai. 8.14. rom. 9.32.\x*fall and rising againe of many in Israel: and for a signe which shall be spoken against,
\v 35 (Yea a sword shall pearce thorow thy owne soule also) that the thoughts of many hearts may be reuealed.
\v 36 And there was one Anna a Prophetesse, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser; she was of a great age, and had liued with an husband seuen yeeres from her virginitie.
\v 37 And she \add was\add* a widow of about fourescore and foure yeeres, which departed not from the Temple, but serued \add God\add* with fastings and prayers night and day.
\v 38 And she comming in that instant, gaue thankes likewise vnto the Lord, and spake of him to al them that looked for redemption in \f + \fr 2:38 \ft Or, Israel.\f*Hierusalem.
\v 39 And when they had performed all things according to the Lawe of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their owne citie Nazareth.
\v 40 And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit filled with wisedome, and the grace of God was vpon him.
\v 41 Now his parents went to Hierusalem \x + \xo 2:41 \xt Deu. 16.1.\x*euery yeere, at the feast of the Passeouer.
\v 42 And when he was twelue yeeres old, they went vp to Hierusalem, after the custome of the feast.
\v 43 And when they had fulfilled the dayes, as they returned, the childe Iesus taried behind in Hierusalem, and Ioseph and his mother knew not \add of it\add*.
\v 44 But they supposing him to haue bene in the company, went a daies iourney, and they sought him among \add their\add* kinsefolke and acquaintance.
\v 45 And when they found him not, they turned backe againe to Hierusalem, seeking him.
\v 46 And it came to passe, that after three daies they found him in the Temple, sitting in the midst of the Doctours, both hearing them, and asking them questions.
\v 47 And all that heard him were astonished at his vnderstanding, and answeres.
\v 48 And when they sawe him, they were amazed: and his mother said vnto him, Sonne, why hast thou thus dealt with vs? Behold, thy father and I haue sought thee sorrowing.
\v 49 And he said vnto them, How is it that ye sought me? Wist yee not that I must bee about my fathers businesse?
\v 50 And they vnderstood not the saying which he spake vnto them.
\v 51 And he went downe with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subiect vnto them: But his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.
\v 52 And Iesus increased in wisedom and \f + \fr 2:52 \ft Or, age.\f*stature, and in fauour with God and man.

\iex 1 The preaching and baptisme of Iohn: 15 His testimonie of Christ. 20 Herode imprisoneth Iohn. 21 Christ baptized, receiueth testimony from heauen. 23 The age, and genealogie of Christ, from Ioseph vpwards.
\v 1 ¶ Now in the fifteenth yeere of the reigne of Tiberius Cesar, Pontius Pilate being Gouernour of Iudea, & Herode being Tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip Tetrarch of Iturea, and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the Tetrarch of Abilene,
\v 2 Annas and Caiaphas being the high Priests, the word of God came vnto Iohn the sonne of Zacharias, in the wildernesse.
\v 3 \x + \xo 3:3 \xt Mat. 3.1.\x*And he came into all the countrey about Iordane, preaching the baptisme of repentance, for the remissiō of sinnes,
\v 4 As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the Prophet, saying, \x + \xo 3:4 \xt Esai. 40.3.\x*The voyce of one crying in the wildernesse, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
\v 5 Euery valley shall be filled, and euery mountaine and hill shalbe brought low, and the crooked shall bee made straight, and the rough wayes \add shall be\add* made smooth.
\v 6 And all flesh shal see the saluation of God.
\v 7 Then said hee to the multitude that came forth to bee baptized of him, \x + \xo 3:7 \xt Mat. 3.7.\x*O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
\v 8 Bring forth therfore fruits \f + \fr 3:8 \ft Or, meet for.\f*worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within your selues, We haue Abraham to \add our\add* father: For I say vnto you, that God is able of these stones to raise vp children vnto Abraham.
\v 9 And now also the axe is laid vnto the root of the trees: Euery tree therefore which bringeth not foorth good fruit, is hewen downe, and cast into the fire.
\v 10 And the people asked him, saying, What shall we doe then?
\v 11 He answereth, and saith vnto them, \x + \xo 3:11 \xt Iam. 2.15. 1.ioh. 3.17.\x*He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none, and he that hath meat, let him doe likewise.
\v 12 Then came also Publicanes to be baptized, and said vnto him, Master, what shall we doe?
\v 13 And he said vnto them, Exact no more then that which is appointed you.
\v 14 And the souldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we doe? And he said vnto them, \f + \fr 3:14 \ft Or, put no man in feare.\f*Doe violence to no man, neither accuse \add any\add* falsely, & be content with your \f + \fr 3:14 \ft Or, allowance.\f*wages.
\v 15 And as the people were \f + \fr 3:15 \ft Or, in suspence.\f*in expectation, and all men \f + \fr 3:15 \ft Or, reasoned or debated.\f*mused in their hearts of Iohn, whether he were the Christ or not:
\v 16 Iohn answered, saying vnto \add them\add* all, \x + \xo 3:16 \xt Mat. 3.11\x*I indeede baptize you with water, but one mightier then I commeth, the latchet of whose shooes I am not worthy to vnloose, he shall baptize you with the holy Ghost, and with fire.
\v 17 Whose fanne \add is\add* in his hand, and he will thorowly purge his floore, and will gather the wheat into his garner, but the chaffe he will burne with fire vnquencheable.
\v 18 And many other things in his exhortation preached he vnto the people.
\v 19 \x + \xo 3:19 \xt Mat. 14.3.\x*But Herode the Tetrarch being reprooued by him for Herodias his brother Philips wife, and for all the euils which Herode had done,
\v 20 Added yet this aboue all, that he shut vp Iohn in prison.
\v 21 Now when all the people were baptized, \x + \xo 3:21 \xt Mat. 3.13.\x*and it came to passe that Iesus also being baptized, and praying, the heauen was opened:
\v 22 And the holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a Doue vpon him, and a voice came from heauen, which said, Thou art my beloued sonne, in thee I am well pleased.
\v 23 And Iesus himselfe began to be about thirty yeeres of age, being (as was supposed) the sonne of Ioseph, which was \add the sonne\add* of Heli,

\v 3 And the deuil saide vnto him, If thou be the Sonne of God, command this stone that it be made bread.
\v 4 And Iesus answered him, saying, It is written, that man shall not liue by bread alone, but by euery word of God.
\v 5 And the deuil taking him vp into an high mountaine, shewed vnto him all the kingdomes of the world in a moment of time.
\v 6 And the deuil said vnto him, All this power will I giue thee, and the glory of them; for that is deliuered vnto me, & to whomsoeuer I will, I giue it.
\v 7 If thou therefore wilt \f + \fr 4:7 \ft Or, fall downe before me.\f*worship me, all shalbe thine.
\v 8 And Iesus answered and said vnto him, Get thee behinde me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him onely shalt thou serue.
\v 9 And hee brought him to Hierusalem, and set him on a pinacle of the Temple, and said vnto him, If thou be the Sonne of God, cast thy selfe downe from hence.
\v 10 For it is written, He shall giue his Angels charge ouer thee, to keepe thee.
\v 11 And in \add their\add* handes they shall beare thee vp, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
\v 12 And Iesus answering, said vnto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
\v 13 And when the deuil had ended all the temptation, hee departed from him for a season.
\v 14 ¶ And Iesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about.
\v 15 And hee taught in their Synagogues, being glorified of all.
\v 16 ¶ And hee came to \x + \xo 4:16 \xt Matt. 13.54.\x*Nazareth, where he had bene brought vp, and as his custome was, he went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood vp for to reade.
\v 17 And there was deliuered vnto him the booke of the Prophet Esaias, and when he had opened the Booke, he found the place where it was written,
\v 18 \x + \xo 4:18 \xt Esay 61.1.\x*The Spirit of the Lord \add is\add* vpon mee, because hee hath anointed mee, to preach the Gospel to the poore, he hath sent mee to heale the broken hearted, to preach deliuerance to the captiues, and recouering of sight to the blinde, to set at libertie them that are bruised,
\v 19 To preach the acceptable yeere of the Lord.
\v 20 And he closed the booke, and hee gaue \add it\add* againe to the minister, and sate downe: and the eyes of all them that were in the Synagogue were fastened on him.
\v 21 And hee began to say vnto them, This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your eares.
\v 22 And all bare him witnesse, and wondered at the gracious wordes, which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Iosephs sonne?
\v 23 And hee said vnto them, Yee will surely say vnto me this prouerbe, Physition, heale thy selfe: Whatsoeuer wee haue heard done in Capernaum, doe also here in thy countrey.
\v 24 And hee said, Verely I say vnto you, no \x + \xo 4:24 \xt Matth. 13.57.\x*Prophet is accepted in his owne countrey.
\v 25 But I tell you of a trueth, \x + \xo 4:25 \xt 1.King. 17.9.\x*many widowes were in Israel in the dayes of Elias, when the heauen was shut vp three yeres and sixe moneths: when great famine was throughout all the land:

\v 27 \x + \xo 4:27 \xt 2.King. 5.14.\x*And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elizeus the Prophet: and none of them was cleansed, sauing Naaman the Syrian.
\v 28 And all they in the Synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,
\v 29 And rose vp, and thrust him out of the citie, & led him vnto the \f + \fr 4:29 \ft Or, edge.\f*brow of the hill (whereon their city was built) that they might cast him downe headlong.
\v 30 But he passing thorow the mids of them, went his way:
\v 31 And came downe to Capernaum, a citie of Galile, and taught them on the Sabbath dayes.
\v 32 And they were astonished at his doctrine: \x + \xo 4:32 \xt Mat. 7.29.\x*for his worde was with power.
\v 33 ¶ \x + \xo 4:33 \xt Mat. 1.23.\x*And in the Synagogue there was a man which had a spirit of an vncleane deuill, and cryed out with a loud voice,
\v 34 Saying, \f + \fr 4:34 \ft Or, away.\f*Let \add vs\add* alone, what haue wee to doe with thee, \add thou\add* Iesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy \add vs\add*? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.
\v 35 And Iesus rebuked him, saying, Holde thy peace, and come out of him. And when the deuill had throwen him in the middes, hee came out of him, and hurt him not.
\v 36 And they were all amazed, and spake among themselues, saying, What a word \add is\add* this? for with authoritie and power hee commaundeth the vncleane spirits, and they come out.
\v 37 And the fame of him went out into euery place of the countrey round about.
\v 38 ¶ \x + \xo 4:38 \xt Mat. 8.14.\x*And he arose out of the Synagogue, and entred into Simons house: and Simons wiues mother was taken with a great feuer, and they besought him for her.
\v 39 And he stood ouer her, and rebuked the feuer, & it left her. And immediatly she arose, & ministred vnto them.
\v 40 ¶ Now when the Sunne was setting, all they that had any sicke with diuers diseases, brought them vnto him: and hee laid his handes on euery one of them, and healed them.
\v 41 \x + \xo 4:41 \xt Mat. 1.34.\x*And deuils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Sonne of God. And hee rebuking \add them\add*, suffered them not \f + \fr 4:41 \ft Or, to say that they knew him to be Christ.\f*to speake: for they knewe that hee was Christ.
\v 42 And when it was day, he departed, and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came vnto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them.
\v 43 And hee said vnto them, I must preach the kingdome of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent.
\v 44 And hee preached in the Synagogues of Galile.

\iex 1 Christ teacheth the people out of Peters ship. 4 In a miraculous taking of fishes, sheweth how he wil make him and his partners fishers of men: 12 Cleanseth the leper: 16 Prayeth in the wildernesse: 18 Healeth one sicke of the palsie: 27 Calleth Matthew the Publicane: 29 Eateth with sinners, as being the Physician of soules: 34 Foretelleth the fastings and afflictions of the Apostles after his ascension: 36 And likeneth faint hearted and weake disciples, to olde bottels and worne garments.
\v 1 ¶ And \x + \xo 5:1 \xt Mat. 4.18.\x*it came to passe, that as the people preassed vpon him to heare the word of God, hee stood by the lake of Genesareth,
\v 2 And sawe two ships standing by the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing \add their\add* nets.
\v 3 And he entred into one of the ships, which was Simons, and prayed him, that he would thrust out a little from the land: and he sate downe, and taught the people out of the ship.
\v 4 Now when he had left speaking, he said vnto Simon, Lanch out into the deepe, and let downe your nets for a draught.
\v 5 And Simon answering, said vnto him, Master, wee haue toiled all the night, and haue taken nothing: neuerthelesse at thy word I will let downe the net.
\v 6 And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes, and their net brake:
\v 7 And they beckened vnto \add their\add* partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and helpe them. And they came, & filled both the ships, so that they began to sinke.
\v 8 When Simon Peter saw \add it\add*, he fell downe at Iesus knees, saying, Depart from me, for I am a sinfull man, O Lord.
\v 9 For he was astonished, and al that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken.
\v 10 And so \add was\add* also Iames, and Iohn the sonnes of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Iesus said vnto Simon, Feare not, from henceforth thou shalt catch men.
\v 11 And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsooke all, and followed him.
\v 12 ¶ \x + \xo 5:12 \xt Mat 8.2.\x*And it came to passe, when he was in a certaine citie, behold a man full of leprosie: who seeing Iesus, fell on \add his\add* face, & besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me cleane.
\v 13 And he put forth \add his\add* hand, and touched him, saying, I wil: be thou cleane. And immediatly the leprosie departed from him.
\v 14 And hee charged him to tell no man: but, Goe, and shewe thy selfe to the Priest, and offer for thy clensing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimonie vnto them.
\v 15 But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him, and great multitudes came together to heare, and to be healed by him of their infirmities.
\v 16 ¶ And he withdrew himselfe into the wildernesse, and prayed.
\v 17 And it came to passe on a certaine day, as hee was teaching, that there were Pharisees and Doctours of the Law sitting by, which were come out of euery towne of Galilee, and Iudea, and Hierusalem: and the power of the Lord was \add present\add* to heale them.
\v 18 ¶ \x + \xo 5:18 \xt Mat. 9.2.\x*And behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsie: and they sought meanes to bring \add him\add* in, and to lay him before him.
\v 19 And when they could not find by what \add way\add* they might bring him in, because of the multitude, they went vpon the house top, & let him downe through the tiling with \add his\add* couch, into the midst before Iesus.
\v 20 And when he saw their faith, hee said vnto him, Man, thy sinnes are forgiuen thee.
\v 21 And the Scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgiue sinnes, but God alone?
\v 22 But when Iesus perceiued their thoughts, he answering, saide vnto them, What reason ye in your hearts?
\v 23 Whether is easier to say, Thy sinnes be forgiuen thee: or to say, Rise vp and walke?
\v 24 But that ye may know that the Sonne of man hath power vpon earth to forgiue sinnes (he said vnto the sicke of the palsie,) I say vnto thee, Arise, and take vp thy couch, and go into thine house.
\v 25 And immediatly he rose vp before them, and tooke vp that whereon hee lay, and departed to his owne house, glorifying God.
\v 26 And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with feare, saying, Wee haue seene strange things to day.
\v 27 ¶ \x + \xo 5:27 \xt Mat. 9.9.\x*And after these things hee went foorth, and sawe a Publicane, named Leui, sitting at the receit of custome: and hee said vnto him, Follow me.
\v 28 And he left all, rose vp, and followed him.
\v 29 And Leui made him a great feast in his owne house: and there was a great company of Publicanes, and of others that sate downe with them.
\v 30 But their Scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why doe ye eate and drinke with Publicanes and sinners?
\v 31 And Iesus answering, said vnto them, They that are whole need not a physician: but they that are sicke.
\v 32 I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
\v 33 ¶ And they said vnto him, \x + \xo 5:33 \xt Mat. 9.14.\x*Why doe the disciples of Iohn fast often, and make prayers, and likewise \add the disciples\add* of the Pharisees: but thine eat and drinke?
\v 34 And he said vnto them, Can yee make the children of the Bride-chamber fast, while the Bridegrome is with them?
\v 35 But the dayes will come, when the Bridegrome shall bee taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those dayes.
\v 36 ¶ And he spake also a parable vnto them, No man putteth a piece of a newe garment vpon an olde: if otherwise, then both the newe maketh a rent, and the piece that was \add taken\add* out of the new, agreeth not with the olde.
\v 37 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish.
\v 38 But newe wine must be put into newe bottles, and both are preserued.
\v 39 No man also hauing drunke olde \add wine\add*, straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better.

\iex 1 Christ reproueth the Pharises blindnesse about the obseruation of the Sabbath, by Scripture, reason, and miracle: 13 Chooseth twelue Apostles: 17 Healeth the diseased: 20 Preacheth to his disciples before the people of blessings, and curses: 27 How we must loue our enemies: 46 And ioyne the obedience of good workes, to the hearing of the word: least in the euill day of temptation, we fall like an house built vpon the face of the earth, without any foundation.
\v 1 ¶ \x + \xo 6:1 \xt Marke 12 1.\x*And it came to passe on the second Sabbath after the first, that he went thorow the corne fields: and his disciples plucked the eares of corne, and did eate, rubbing \add them\add* in \add their\add* hands.
\v 2 And certaine of the Pharisees said vnto them, Why doe yee that which is not lawfull to doe on the Sabbath dayes?
\v 3 And Iesus answering them, said, Haue yee not read so much as this what Dauid did, when himselfe was an hungred, and they which were with him:
\v 4 How he went into the house of God, and did take and eate the Shew bread, and gaue also to them that were with him, which it is not lawful to eate but for the Priests alone?
\v 5 And he said vnto them, That the sonne of man is Lord also of the Sabbath.
\v 6 \x + \xo 6:6 \xt Mat. 12.9.\x*And it came to passe also on another Sabbath, that he entred into the Synagogue, and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was withered.
\v 7 And the Scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heale on the Sabbath day: that they might find an accusation against him.
\v 8 But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise vp, and stand foorth in the mids. And he arose, and stood foorth.
\v 9 Then said Iesus vnto them, I will aske you one thing, Is it lawfull on the Sabbath dayes to doe good, or to doe euill? to saue life, or to destroy it?
\v 10 And looking round about vpon them all, he said vnto the man, Stretch foorth thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other.
\v 11 And they were filled with madnesse, and communed one with another what they might doe to Iesus.
\v 12 And it came to passe in those dayes, that hee went out into a mountaine to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God.
\v 13 ¶ \x + \xo 6:13 \xt Mat.10.1\x*And when it was day, he called \add vnto him\add* his disciples: and of them he chose twelue; whom also hee named Apostles:

\v 18 And they that were vexed with vncleane spirits: and they were healed.
\v 19 And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went vertue out of him, and healed \add them\add* all.

\v 45 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart, bringeth foorth that which is good: and an euill man out of the euill treasure of his heart, bringeth foorth that which is euill: For of the abundance of the heart, his mouth speaketh.

\iex 1 Christ findeth a greater faith in the Centurion a Gentile, then in any of the Iewes: 10 Healeth his seruant being absent: 11 Raiseth from death the widowes sonne at Naim: 19 Answereth Iohns messengers with the declaration of his miracles: 24 Testifieth to the people what opinion hee held of Iohn: 30 Inueigheth against the Iewes, who with neither the maners of Iohn, nor of Iesus could be wonne: 36 and sheweth by occasion of Marie Magdalene, how he is a friend to sinners, not to maintaine them in sinnes, but to forgiue them their sinnes, vpon their faith and repentance.
\v 1 ¶ \x + \xo 7:1 \xt Matth.8.5.\x*Now when hee had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, hee entred into Capernaum.

\v 3 And when he heard of Iesus, he sent vnto him the Elders of the Iewes, beseeching him that he would come and heale his seruant.
\v 4 And when they came to Iesus, they besought him instantly, saying, that hee was worthy for whome hee should doe this.
\v 5 For he loueth our nation, and hee hath built vs a Synagogue.
\v 6 Then Iesus went with them. And when he was now not farre from the house, the Centurion sent friends to him, saying vnto him, Lord, trouble not thy selfe: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter vnder my roofe.
\v 7 Wherefore neither thought I my selfe worthy to come vnto thee: but say in a worde, and my seruant shall bee healed.
\v 8 For I also am a man set vnder authoritie, hauing vnder mee souldiers: and I say vnto one, Goe, and he goeth: and to another, Come, and hee commeth: and to my seruant, Doe this, and he doeth \add it\add*.
\v 9 When Iesus heard these things, hee marueiled at him, and turned him about, and saide vnto the people that followed him, I say vnto you, I haue not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.
\v 10 And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the seruant whole that had bene sicke.

\v 12 Now when he came nigh to the gate of the citie, behold, there was a dead man caried out, the onely sonne of his mother, and shee was a widow: and much people of the citie was with her.

\v 15 And he that was dead, sate vp, and began to speake: and he deliuered him to his mother.
\v 16 And there came a feare on all, and they glorified God, saying, that a great Prophet is risen vp among vs, and that God hath visited his people.
\v 17 And this rumour of him went foorth throughout all Iudea, and throughout all the region round about.
\v 18 \x + \xo 7:18 \xt Mat. 11.2.\x*And the disciples of Iohn shewed him of all these things.

\v 20 When the men were come vnto him, they said, Iohn Baptist hath sent vs vnto thee, saying, Art thou hee that should come, or looke we for another?
\v 21 And in that same houre hee cured many of \add their\add* infirmities and plagues, and of euill spirits, and vnto many \add that were\add* blind, he gaue sight.
\v 22 Then Iesus answering, said vnto them, Go your way, and tell Iohn what things ye haue seene and heard, how that the blind see, the lame walke, the lepers are clensed, the deafe heare, the dead are raised, to the poore the Gospel is preached.
\v 23 And blessed is \add he\add* whosoeuer shall not be offended in me.
\v 24 ¶ And when the messengers of Iohn were departed, hee beganne to speake vnto y\sup e\sup* people concerning Iohn: What went ye out into the wildernesse for to see? A reede shaken with the winde?
\v 25 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and liue delicately, are in kings courts.
\v 26 But what went ye out for to see? A Prophet? Yea, I say vnto you, and much more then a Prophet.
\v 27 This is \add he\add* of whome it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.
\v 28 For I say vnto you, among those that are borne of women, there is not a greater Prophet then Iohn the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdome of God, is greater then he.

\v 32 They are like vnto children sitting in the market place, & calling one to another, and saying, We haue piped vnto you, and ye haue not danced: wee haue mourned to you, and yee haue not wept.
\v 33 For Iohn the Baptist came, neither eating bread, nor drinking wine, and ye say, He hath a deuill.
\v 34 The sonne of man is come, eating, and drinking, and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a wine bibber, a friend of Publicanes and sinners.

\v 6 And some fell vpon a rocke, and assoone as it was sprung vp, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.

\v 9 And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?
\v 10 And he said, Unto you it is giuen to know the mysteries of the kingdome of God: but to others in parables, that seeing, they might not see, and hearing, they might not vnderstand.
\v 11 \x + \xo 8:11 \xt Mat. 13.18.\x*Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.

\v 13 They on the rocke, \add are they\add* which when they heare, receiue the word with ioy; and these haue no roote, which for a while beleeue, and in time of temptation fall away.
\v 14 And that which fell among thornes, are they, which when they haue heard, goe forth, and are choked with cares and riches, and pleasures of \add this\add* life, and bring no fruite to perfection.
\v 15 But that on the good ground, are they, which in an honest and good heart hauing heard the word, keepe \add it\add*, and bring foorth fruite with patience.

\v 30 And Iesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion: because many deuils were entred into him.
\v 31 And they besought him, that he would not command them to goe out into the deepe.
\v 32 And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountaine: and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them: and he suffered them.
\v 33 Then went the deuils out of the man, and entred into the swine: and the herd ran violently downe a steepe place into the lake, and were choked.
\v 34 When they that fed \add them\add* saw what was done, they fled, and went, and tolde \add it\add* in the citie, and in the countrey.

\v 38 Now the man, out of whom the deuils were departed, besought him that he might be with him: but Iesus sent him away, saying,

\v 45 And Iesus saide, Who touched mee? When all denied, Peter and they that were with him, said, Master, the multitude throng thee, and preasse \add thee\add*, and sayest thou, Who touched me?
\v 46 And Iesus saide, Some body hath touched mee: for I perceiue that vertue is gone out of me.
\v 47 And when the woman saw that she was not hid, shee came trembling, and falling downe before him, shee declared vnto him before all the people, for what cause shee had touched him, and how she was healed immediatly.
\v 48 And he said vnto her, Daughter, be of good comfort, thy faith hath made thee whole, goe in peace.)

\v 50 But when Iesus heard \add it\add*, he answered him, saying, Feare not, beleeue onely, and she shalbe made whole.
\v 51 And when hee came into the house, hee suffered no man to goe in, saue Peter, and Iames, and Iohn, and the father and the mother of the mayden.
\v 52 And all wept, and bewailed her: but he said, Weepe not, she is not dead, but sleepeth.
\v 53 And they laughed him to scorne, knowing that she was dead.
\v 54 And hee put them all out, and tooke her by the hand, and called, saying, Mayd, arise.

\v 33 But a certaine Samaritane as he iourneyed, came where he was; and when hee saw him, hee had compassion \add on him\add*,
\v 34 And went to \add him\add*, and bound vp his wounds, powring in oile and wine, and set him on his owne beast, and brought him to an Inne, and tooke care of him.
\v 35 \x + \xo 10:35 \xt See Matt. 20.2.\x*And on the morrow when he departed, hee tooke out two pence, and gaue \add them\add* to the hoste, and saide vnto him, Take care of him, and whatsoeuer thou spendest more, when I come againe I will repay thee.
\v 36 Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour vnto him that fell among the theeues?
\v 37 And he said, He that shewed mercie on him. Then said Iesus vnto him, Goe, and doe thou likewise.
\v 38 ¶ Now it came to passe, as they went, that he entred into a certaine village: and a certaine woman named Martha, receiued him into her house.
\v 39 And shee had a sister called Mary, which also sate at Iesus feet, and heard his word:
\v 40 But Martha was cumbred about much seruing, and came to him, and said, Lord, doest thou not care that my sister hath left mee to serue alone? Bid her therefore that she helpe me.
\v 41 And Iesus answered, and saide vnto her, Martha, Martha, thou art carefull, and troubled about many things:
\v 42 But one thing is needefull, and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not bee taken away from her.

\iex 1 Christ teacheth to pray, and that instantly: 11 assuring that God so will giue vs good things. 14 He casting out a dumbe deuil, rebuketh the blasphemous Pharisees: 28 and sheweth who are blessed: 29 preacheth to the people, 37 and reprehendeth the outward shew of holinesse in the Pharisees, Scribes and Lawyers.
\v 1 ¶ And it came to passe, that as he was praying in a certaine place, when hee ceased, one of his disciples said vnto him, Lord, teach vs to pray, as Iohn also taught his disciples.
\v 2 \x + \xo 11:2 \xt Matth 6.9\x*And hee said vnto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heauen, Halowed be thy Name, Thy kingdome come, Thy will be done as in heauen, so in earth.
\v 3 \f + \fr 11:3 \ft Or, for the day.\f*Giue vs day by day our dayly bread.
\v 4 And forgiue vs our sinnes: for we also forgiue euery one that is indebted to vs. And lead vs not into temptation, but deliuer vs from euill.
\v 5 And he said vnto them, Which of you shall haue a friend, and shall goe vnto him at midnight, and say vnto him, Friend, lend me three loaues.
\v 6 \f + \fr 11:6 \ft Or, out of his way.\f*For a friend of mine in his iourney is come to me, and I haue nothing to set before him,
\v 7 And he from within shal answere and say, Trouble mee not, the doore is now shut, and my children are with me in bed: I cannot rise and giue thee.
\v 8 I say vnto you, Though he will not rise, and giue him, because he is his friend: yet because of his importunitie, hee will rise and giue him as many as he needeth.
\v 9 \x + \xo 11:9 \xt Matth.7.7.\x*And I say vnto you, Aske, and it shalbe giuen you: seeke, and ye shal find: knocke, and it shalbe opened vnto you.
\v 10 For euery one that asketh, receiueth: and he that seeketh, findeth: and to him that knocketh, it shalbe opened.
\v 11 \x + \xo 11:11 \xt Matth.7.9.\x*If a sonne shall aske bread of any of you that is a father, will hee giue him a stone? Or if he aske a fish, will he for a fish giue him a serpent?
\v 12 Or if he shall aske an egge, will he offer him a scorpion?
\v 13 If ye then, being euill, know how to giue good gifts vnto your children: how much more shall \add your\add* heauenly Father giue the holy Spirit to them that aske him?
\v 14 ¶ And he was casting out a deuil, and it was dumbe. And it came to passe, when the deuill was gone out, the dumbe spake: and the people wondred.
\v 15 \x + \xo 11:15 \xt Mat.9.34. and 12.24.\x*But some of them said, Hee casteth out deuils through Beelzebub the chiefe of the deuils.
\v 16 And other tempting \add him\add*, sought of him a signe from heauen.
\v 17 But he knowing their thoughts, said vnto them, Euery kingdome \add diuided\add* against it selfe, is brought to desolation: and a house diuided against a house, falleth.
\v 18 If Satan also be diuided against himselfe, how shall his kingdom stand? Because yee say that I cast out deuils through Beelzebub.
\v 19 And if I by Beelzebub cast out deuils, by whom doe your sonnes cast \add them\add* out? therefore shall they be your iudges.
\v 20 But if I with the finger of God cast out deuils, no doubt the kingdome of God is come vpon you.
\v 21 When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace:
\v 22 But when a stronger then he shal come vpon him, and ouercome him, hee taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and diuideth his spoiles.
\v 23 He that is not with me, is against me: and hee that gathereth not with me, scattereth.
\v 24 \x + \xo 11:24 \xt Mat. 12.43.\x*When the vncleane spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through drie places, seeking rest: and finding none, he sayth, I will returne vnto my house whence I came out.
\v 25 And when hee commeth, hee findeth \add it\add* swept and garnished.
\v 26 Then goeth he, and taketh \add to him\add* seuen other spirits more wicked then himselfe, and they enter in, and dwell there, and the last \add state\add* of that man is worse then the first.
\v 27 ¶ And it came to passe as hee spake these things, a certaine woman of the company lift vp her voice, and said vnto him, Blessed \add is\add* the wombe that bare thee, and the pappes which thou hast sucked.
\v 28 But hee said, Yea, rather blessed \add are\add* they that heare the word of God, and keepe it.
\v 29 ¶ \x + \xo 11:29 \xt Matt. 12.38.\x*And when the people were gathered thicke together, hee began to say, This is an euill generation, they seeke a signe, and there shall no signe be giuen it, but the signe of Ionas the Prophet:
\v 30 For as Ionas was a signe vnto the Nineuites, so shall also the Sonne of man be to this generation.
\v 31 The Queene of the South shall rise vp in the iudgement with the men of this generation, & condemne them: for shee came from the vtmost parts of the earth, to heare the wisedome of Solomon: and behold, a greater then Solomon \add is\add* here.
\v 32 The men of Nineue shall rise vp in the iudgement with this generation, and shall condemne it: for they repented at the preaching of Ionas, and behold, a greater then Ionas \add is\add* here.
\v 33 \x + \xo 11:33 \xt Mat.5.15.\x*\x + \xo 11:33 \xt See Matt. 5.15.\x*No man when he hath lighted a candle, putteth \add it\add* in a secret place, neither vnder a bushell, but on a candlesticke, that they which come in may see the light.
\v 34 \x + \xo 11:34 \xt Mat.6.22\x*The light of the body is the eye: therefore when thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light: but when \add thine eye\add* \add is\add* euill, thy body also is full of darkenesse.
\v 35 Take heede therefore, that the light which is in thee, be not darknesse.
\v 36 If thy whole body therefore \add be\add* full of light, hauing no part darke, the whole shalbe full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle doeth giue thee light.
\v 37 ¶ And as he spake, a certaine Pharise besought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sate downe to meate.
\v 38 And when the Pharise saw \add it\add*, he marueiled that he had not first washed before dinner.
\v 39 \x + \xo 11:39 \xt Mat. 23.25.\x*And the Lord said vnto him, Now doe ye Pharises make cleane the outside of the cup and the platter: but your inward part is full of rauening and wickednesse.
\v 40 Yee fooles, did not he that made that which is without, make that which is within also?
\v 41 \f + \fr 11:41 \ft Or, as you are able.\f*But rather giue almes of such things as you haue: and behold, all things are cleane vnto you.
\v 42 But woe vnto you Pharises: for ye tythe Mint and Rue, and all maner of herbes, and passe ouer iudgement, and the loue of God: these ought yee to haue done, and not to leaue the other vndone.
\v 43 \x + \xo 11:43 \xt Mat.23.6\x*Woe vnto you Pharisees: for ye loue the vppermost seats in the Synagogues, and greetings in the markets.
\v 44 Woe vnto you Scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites: for ye are as graues which appeare not, and the men that walk ouer \add them\add*, are not aware \add of them\add*.
\v 45 ¶ Then answered one of the Lawyers, and said vnto him, Master, thus saying, thou reprochest vs also.
\v 46 \x + \xo 11:46 \xt Mat. 23.4\x*And he said, Woe vnto you also \add ye\add* lawyers: for ye lade men with burdens grieuous to be borne, and ye your selues touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.
\v 47 \x + \xo 11:47 \xt Matth. 23 29.\x*Woe vnto you: for ye build the sepulchres of the Prophets, and your fathers killed them.
\v 48 Truely ye beare witnesse that ye allowe the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and yee build their sepulchres.
\v 49 Therefore also said the wisedome of God, I wil send them Prophets and Apostles, and \add some\add* of them they shal slay and persecute:
\v 50 That the blood of all the Prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation,
\v 51 \x + \xo 11:51 \xt Gen. 4.8.\x*From the blood of Abel vnto the blood of Zacharias, which perished betweene the Altar and the Temple: Uerely I say vnto you, it shall be required of this generation.
\v 52 \x + \xo 11:52 \xt Matth. 23 13.\x*\f + \fr 11:52 \ft Or forbade\f*Woe vnto you Lawyers: for ye haue taken away the key of knowledge: ye entred not in your selues, and them that were entring in, ye hindred.
\v 53 And as he said these things vnto them, the Scribes and the Pharisees began to vrge \add him\add* vehemently, and to prouoke him to speake of many things:
\v 54 Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.
\c 12
\iex 1 Christ preacheth to his disciples to auoid hypocrisie, and fearefulnesse in publishing his doctrine: 13 Warneth the people to beware of couetousnes, by the parable of the rich man who set vp greater barnes. 22 We must not be ouer carefull of earthly things, 31 but seeke the kingdome of God, 33 giue almes, 36 bee ready at a knocke to open to our Lord whensoeuer he commeth. 41 Christs ministers are to see to their charge, 49 and looke for persecution. 54 The people must take this time of grace, 58 because it is a fearefull thing to die without reconciliation.
\v 1 ¶ \x + \xo 12:1 \xt Mat. 16.6.\x*In the meane time, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one vpon another, he began to say vnto his disciples first of all, Beware yee of the leauen of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisie.
\v 2 \x + \xo 12:2 \xt Matth. 10.26.\x*For there is nothing couered, that shall not be reuealed, neither hid, that shall not be knowen.
\v 3 Therefore, whatsoeuer yee haue spoken in darkenesse, shall bee heard in the light: and that which yee haue spoken in the eare, in closets, shal be proclaimed vpon the house tops.
\v 4 \x + \xo 12:4 \xt Matth. 10 28.\x*And I say vnto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that, haue no more that they can doe.
\v 5 But I will forewarne you whom you shall feare: Feare him, which after he hath killed, hath power to cast into hell, yea, I say vnto you, Feare him.
\v 6 \x + \xo 12:6 \xt See Matt. 10.29.\x*Are not fiue sparrowes solde for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?
\v 7 But euen the very haires of your head are all numbred: Feare not therefore, ye are of more value then many sparrowes.
\v 8 \x + \xo 12:8 \xt Matth. 10 32. 2.tim. 2.12.\x*Also I say vnto you, Whosoeuer shall confesse me before men, him shall the Sonne of man also confesse before the Angels of God.
\v 9 But he that denieth me before men, shalbe denied before the Angels of God.
\v 10 And whosoeuer shall speake a word against the Sonne of man, it shall be forgiuen him: but vnto him that blasphemeth against the holy Ghost, it shal not be forgiuen.
\v 11 \x + \xo 12:11 \xt Matth.10.19.\x*And when they bring you vnto the Synagogues, and vnto Magistrates, & powers, take yee no thought how or what thing ye shall answere, or what ye shall say:
\v 12 For the holy Ghost shal teach you in the same houre, what ye ought to say.
\v 13 ¶ And one of the company saide vnto him, Master, speake to my brother, that he diuide the inheritance with me.
\v 14 And he said vnto him, Man, who made mee a iudge, or a diuider ouer you?
\v 15 And he said vnto them, Take heed and beware of couetousnes: for a mans life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.
\v 16 And he spake a parable vnto them, saying, The ground of a certaine rich man brought foorth plentifully.
\v 17 And he thought within himselfe, saying, What shall I doe, because I haue no roome where to bestow my fruits?
\v 18 And he said, This will I doe, I will pull downe my barnes, and build greater, and there will I bestow all my fruits, and my goods.
\v 19 And I will say to my soule, Soule, thou hast much goods layd vp for many yeeres, take thine ease, eate, drinke, \add and\add* be merry.
\v 20 \f + \fr 12:20 \ft Gre. doe they require thy soule.\f*But God said vnto him, \add Thou\add* foole, this night thy soule shal be required of thee: then whose shal those things be which thou hast prouided?
\v 21 So \add is\add* he that laieth vp treasure for himselfe, and is not rich towards God.
\v 22 ¶ \x + \xo 12:22 \xt Mat. 6.25.\x*And he said vnto his disciples, Therefore I say vnto you, Take no thought for your life what yee shall eate, neither for the body what yee shall put on.
\v 23 The life is more then meate, and the body \add is more\add* then raiment.
\v 24 Consider the rauens, for they neither sow nor reape, which neither haue storehouse nor barne, and God feedeth them: How much more are yee better then the foules?
\v 25 And which of you with taking thought can adde to his stature one cubite?
\v 26 If yee then bee not able to doe that thing which is least, why take yee thought for the rest?
\v 27 Consider the Lillies how they growe, they toile not; they spinne not: and yet I say vnto you, that Solomon in all his glory, was not arayed like one of these.
\v 28 If then God so clothe the grasse, which is to day in the field, and to morrow is cast into the ouen: how much more \add will he clothe\add* you, O ye of litle faith?

\v 30 For all these things doe the nations of the world seeke after: and your father knoweth that yee haue neede of these things.
\v 31 ¶ But rather seeke yee the kingdome of God, and all these things shall be added vnto you.
\v 32 Feare not, litle flocke, for it is your fathers good pleasure to giue you the kingdome.
\v 33 \x + \xo 12:33 \xt Mat. 6.20.\x*Sell that yee haue, and giue almes: prouide your selues bagges which waxe not old, a treasure in the heauens that faileth not, where no theefe approcheth, neither moth corrupteth.

\v 37 Blessed \add are\add* those seruants, whom the Lord when he commeth, shall find watching: Uerily, I say vnto you, That he shall girde himselfe, and make them to sit downe to meate, and will come foorth and serue them.

\v 42 And the Lord said, Who then is that faithfull and wise steward, whom \add his\add* Lord shall make ruler ouer his houshold, to giue \add them their\add* portion of meate in due season?
\v 43 Blessed \add is\add* that seruant, whom his Lord when he commeth, shall find so doing.
\v 44 Of a trueth, I say vnto you, that hee will make him ruler ouer all that he hath.
\v 45 But and if that seruant say in his heart, My Lord delayeth his comming and shall beginne to beat the men seruants, and maidens, and to eate and drinke, and to be drunken:

\v 47 And that seruant which knew his Lords will, and prepared not \add himselfe\add*, neither did according to his will, shalbe beaten with many \add stripes\add*.
\v 48 But hee that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall bee beaten with few \add stripes\add*. For vnto whomsoeuer much is giuen, of him shal bee much required: and to whom men haue committed much, of him they will aske the more.

\iex 1 Christ preacheth repentance vpon the punishment of the Galileans, and others. 6 The fruitlesse figge tree may not stand. 11 Hee healeth the crooked woman: 18 sheweth the powerfull working of the word in the hearts of his chosen, by the parable of the graine of mustard seed, and of leuen: 24 exhorteth to enter in at the straite gate, 31 and reproueth Herode, and Hierusalem.
\v 1 ¶ There were present at that season, some that told him of the Galileans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.
\v 2 And Iesus answering, said vnto them, Suppose ye that these Galileans were sinners aboue all the Galileans, because they suffered such things?
\v 3 I tell you, Nay: but except yee repent, ye shall all likewise perish.

\v 6 ¶ Hee spake also this parable, A certaine \add man\add* had a figtree planted in his Uineyard, and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.
\v 7 Then said hee vnto the dresser of his Uineyard, Beholde, these three yeeres I come seeking fruit on this figtree, and finde none: cut it downe, why cumbreth it the ground?
\v 8 And he answering, said vnto him, Lord, let it alone this yeere also, till I shall digge about it, and doung \add it\add*:
\v 9 And if it beare fruit, Well: and if not, then after that, thou shalt cut it downe.
\v 10 And he was teaching in one of the Synagogues on the Sabbath.
\v 11 ¶ And beholde, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmitie eighteene yeeres, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift vp her selfe.
\v 12 And when Iesus saw her, he called her to him, and said vnto her, Woman, thou art loosed frō thy infirmitie.
\v 13 And hee layd \add his\add* handes on her, and immediatly she was made straight, and glorified God.
\v 14 And the ruler of the Synagogue answered with indignation, because that Iesus had healed on the Sabbath day, and said vnto the people, There are sixe dayes in which men ought to worke: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the Sabbath day.
\v 15 The Lord then answered him, and said, \add Thou\add* hypocrite, doeth not each one of you on the Sabbath loose \add his\add* oxe or his asse from the stall, and leade \add him\add* away to watering?
\v 16 And ought not this woman being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, loe these eighteene yeeres, be loosed from this bond on the Sabbath day?
\v 17 And when hee had said these things, all his aduersaries were ashamed: & all the people reioyced for all the glorious things that were done by him.

\v 19 It is like a graine of mustard seed, which a man tooke, and cast into his garden, and it grew, and waxed a great tree: and the foules of the aire lodged in the branches of it.
\v 20 And againe hee said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdome of God?

\v 6 And they could not answere him againe to these things.
\v 7 ¶ And he put foorth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked howe they chose out the chiefe roumes, saying vnto them,
\v 8 When thou art bidden of any \add man\add* to a wedding, sit not downe in the highest roume: lest a more honourable man then thou be bidden of him,
\v 9 And hee that bade thee and him, come, and say to thee, Giue this man place: and thou begin with shame to take the lowest roume.
\v 10 \x + \xo 14:10 \xt Prou. 25.5\x*But when thou art bidden, goe and sit downe in the lowest roume, that when he that bade thee commeth, hee may say vnto thee, Friend, goe vp higher: then shalt thou haue worship in the presence of them that sit at meate with thee.
\v 11 \x + \xo 14:11 \xt Mat. 23.12.\x*For whosoeuer exalteth himselfe, shalbe abased: and hee that humbleth himselfe, shalbe exalted.
\v 12 ¶ Then said hee also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsemen, nor \add thy\add* rich neighbours, lest they also bid thee againe, and a recompence be made thee.
\v 13 \x + \xo 14:13 \xt Tob.4 7.\x*But when thou makest a feast, call the poore, the maimed, the lame, the blinde,
\v 14 And thou shalt be blessed, for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the iust.
\v 15 ¶ \x + \xo 14:15 \xt Reu. 19.9.\x*And when one of them that sate at meate with him, heard these things, he said vnto him, Blessed \add is\add* hee that shall eate bread in the kingdom of God.
\v 16 \x + \xo 14:16 \xt Mat. 22.2.\x*Then said hee vnto him, A certaine man made a great supper, and bade many:
\v 17 And sent his seruant at supper time, to say to them that were bidden, Come, for all things are now ready.
\v 18 And they all with one \add consent\add* began to make excuse: The first said vnto him, I haue bought a piece of ground, and I must needs goe and see it: I pray thee haue me excused.
\v 19 And another said, I haue bought fiue yoke of oxen, and I goe to prooue them: I pray thee haue me excused.
\v 20 And another said, I haue maried a wife: and therefore I cannot come.
\v 21 So that seruant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry, sayde to his seruant, Goe out quickely into the streetes and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poore, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blinde.
\v 22 And the seruant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is roume.
\v 23 And the Lord said vnto the seruant, Goe out into the high wayes and hedges, and compell \add them\add* to come in, that my house may be filled.
\v 24 For I say vnto you, that none of those men which were bidden, shall taste of my supper.
\v 25 ¶ And there went great multitudes with him: and hee turned, and said vnto them,

\v 27 And whosoeuer doeth not beare his crosse, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.
\v 28 For which of you intending to build a towre, sitteth not downe first, and counteth the cost, whether he haue \add sufficient\add* to finish \add it\add*?
\v 29 Lest haply after hee hath laide the foundation, and is not able to finish \add it\add*, all that behold \add it\add*, begin to mock him,
\v 30 Saying, This man beganne to build, and was not able to finish.
\v 31 Or what king going to make war against another king, sitteth not downe first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand, to meete him that commeth against him with twentie thousand?
\v 32 Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, hee sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace.

\v 15 And he went and ioyned himselfe to a citizen of that countrey, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.
\v 16 And he would faine haue filled his belly with the huskes that the swine did eate: & no man gaue vnto him.
\v 17 And when he came to himselfe, he said, How many hired seruants of my fathers haue bread inough and to spare, and I perish with hunger?
\v 18 I will arise and goe to my father, and will say vnto him, Father, I haue sinned against heauen and before thee.
\v 19 And am no more worthy to be called thy sonne: make me as one of thy hired seruants.
\v 20 And he arose and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ranne, and fell on his necke, and kissed him.
\v 21 And the sonne said vnto him, Father, I haue sinned against heauen, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy sonne.
\v 22 But the father saide to his seruants, Bring foorth the best robe, and put \add it\add* on him, and put a ring on \add his\add* hand, and shooes on his feete.

\v 25 Now his elder sonne was in the field, and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musicke & dauncing,
\v 26 And he called one of the seruants, and asked what these things meant.
\v 27 And he said vnto him, Thy brother is come, and thy father hath killed the fatted calfe, because he hath receiued him safe and sound.
\v 28 And he was angry, and would not goe in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him.
\v 29 And he answering said to \add his\add* father, Loe, these many yeeres doe I serue thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandement, and yet thou neuer gauest mee a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:

\v 2 And hee called him, and said vnto him, How is it that I heare this of thee? Giue an accompt of thy stewardship: for thou mayest bee no longer Steward.
\v 3 Then the Steward said within himselfe, What shall I doe, for my lord taketh away from mee the Stewardship? I cannot digge, to begge I am ashamed.
\v 4 I am resolued what to doe, that when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receiue me into their houses.

\v 5 And when Iesus came to the place, he looked vp and saw him, and said vnto him, Zacheus, make haste, & come downe, for to day I must abide at thy house.
\v 6 And he made haste, and came downe, and receiued him ioyfully.
\v 7 And when they saw \add it\add*, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.
\v 8 And Zacheus stood, and said vnto the Lord, Behold, Lord, the halfe of my goods I giue to the poore, & if I haue taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore \add him\add* foure fold.
\v 9 And Iesus said vnto him, This day is saluation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is the sonne of Abraham.
\v 10 \x + \xo 19:10 \xt Matt.18.11.\x*For the sonne of man is come to seeke, and to saue that which was lost.
\v 11 And as they heard these things, he added, and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Hierusalem, and because they thought that the kingdome of God should immediately appeare.
\v 12 \x + \xo 19:12 \xt Matt.25.14.\x*He said therefore, A certaine noble man went into a farre countrey, to receiue for himselfe a kingdome, and to returne.
\v 13 \f + \fr 19:13 \ft Mina here translated a pound, is twelue ounces and an halfe, which according to fiue shillings the ounce, is 3. pounds two shillings sixe pence.\f*And hee called his ten seruants, and deliuered them ten pounds, and said vnto them, Occupy till I come.
\v 14 But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We wil not haue this \add man\add* to reigne ouer vs.
\v 15 And it came to passe, that when he was returned, hauing receiued the kingdome, then hee commaunded these seruants to be called vnto him, to whom he had giuen the money, that hee might know how much euery man had gained by trading.
\v 16 Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.
\v 17 And he said vnto him, Well, thou good seruant: because thou hast bene faithfull in a very little, haue thou authoritie ouer ten cities.
\v 18 And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained fiue pounds.
\v 19 And hee said likewise to him, Bee thou also ouer fiue cities.
\v 20 And another came, saying, Lord, behold, \add here is\add* thy pound which I haue kept layd vp in a napkin:
\v 21 For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest vp that thou layedst not downe, and reapest that thou didst not sow.
\v 22 And hee saith vnto him, Out of thine owne mouth will I iudge thee, \add thou\add* wicked seruant: Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking vp that I layde not downe, and reaping that I did not sow.
\v 23 Wherefore then gauest not thou my money into the bancke, that at my comming I might haue required mine owne with vsury?
\v 24 And he said vnto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and giue \add it\add* to him that hath ten pounds.
\v 25 And they said vnto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.
\v 26 \x + \xo 19:26 \xt Matth.13.12.\x*For I say vnto you, That vnto euery one which hath, shalbe giuen, and from him that hath not, euen that hee hath shalbe taken away from him.
\v 27 But those mine enemies which would not that I should reigne ouer them, bring hither, and slay \add them\add* before mee.
\v 28 ¶ And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending vp to Hierusalem.
\v 29 \x + \xo 19:29 \xt Matth.21.1.\x*And it came to passe when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethanie, at the mount called \add the mount\add* of Oliues, he sent two of his disciples,
\v 30 Saying, Goe ye into the village ouer against \add you\add*, in the which at your entring ye shall find a Colt tied, whereon yet neuer man sate: loose him, and bring \add him hither\add*.
\v 31 And if any man aske you, Why do ye loose \add him\add*? Thus shall ye say vnto him, Because the Lord hath neede of him.
\v 32 And they that were sent, went their way, and found euen as hee had said vnto them.
\v 33 And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said vnto them, Why loose ye the Colt?
\v 34 And they said, The Lord hath need of him.
\v 35 And they brought him to Iesus: and they cast their garments vpon the Colt, and they set Iesus thereon.
\v 36 And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.
\v 37 And when he was come nigh euen now at the descent of the mount of Oliues, the whole multitude of the disciples began to reioyce and praise God with a loud voice, for all the mighty workes that they had seene,
\v 38 Saying, Blessed \add bee\add* the King that commeth in the Name of the Lord, peace in heauen, and glory in the Highest.
\v 39 And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude saide vnto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.
\v 40 And he answered, and said vnto them, I tell you, that if these should holde their peace, the stones would immediatly cry out.
\v 41 ¶ And when he was come neere, he beheld the city and wept ouer it,
\v 42 Saying, If thou hadst knowen, euen thou, at least in this thy day, the things \add which belong\add* vnto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.
\v 43 For the dayes shall come vpon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compasse thee round, and keepe thee in on euery side,
\v 44 And shall lay thee euen with the ground, and thy children within thee: and they shall not leaue in thee one stone vpon another, because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.
\v 45 \x + \xo 19:45 \xt Matth.21.12.\x*And he went into the Temple, and began to cast out them that solde therein, and them that bought,
\v 46 Saying vnto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye haue made it a denne of theeues.
\v 47 And he taught daily in the Temple. But the chiefe Priestes and the Scribes, and the chiefe of the people sought to destroy him,

\v 1 ¶ \x + \xo 20:1 \xt Matt.21.23.\x*And it came to passe, \add that\add* on one of those dayes, as he taught the people in the Temple, and preached the Gospel, the chiefe Priests and the Scribes came vpon \add him\add*, with the Elders,
\v 2 And spake vnto him, saying, Tell vs, by what authoritie doest thou these things? or who is hee that gaue thee this authoritie?
\v 3 And hee answered, and said vnto them, I will also aske you one thing, and answere me.
\v 4 The Baptisme of Iohn, was it from heauen, or of men?
\v 5 And they reasoned with themselues, saying, If wee shall say, From heauen, he will say, Why then beleeued yee him not?
\v 6 But and if we say, Of men, all the people will stone vs: for they be perswaded that Iohn was a Prophet.
\v 7 And they answered, that they could not tell whence \add it was\add*.
\v 8 And Iesus said vnto them, Neither tell I you by what authoritie I doe these things.
\v 9 \x + \xo 20:9 \xt Mat.21.33.\x*Then began hee to speake to the people this parable: A certaine man planted a vineyard, and let it foorth to husbandmen, and went into a farre countrey for a long time.
\v 10 And at the season, hee sent a seruant to the husbandmen, that they should giue him of the fruit of the vineyard, but the husbandmen beat him, and sent \add him\add* away emptie.
\v 11 And againe hee sent another seruant, and they beat him also, and entreated \add him\add* shamefully, and sent \add him\add* away emptie.
\v 12 And againe he sent the third, and they wounded him also, & cast \add him\add* out.
\v 13 Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I doe? I will send my beloued sonne: it may be they will reuerence \add him\add* when they see him.
\v 14 But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselues, saying, This is y\sup e\sup* heire, come, let vs kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.
\v 15 So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed \add him\add*. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard doe vnto them?
\v 16 Hee shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall giue the vineyard to others. And when they heard \add it\add*, they said, God forbid.
\v 17 \x + \xo 20:17 \xt Psal. 118.22.\x*And hee beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders reiected, the same is become the head of the corner?
\v 18 Whosoeuer shall fall vpon that stone, shalbe broken: but on whomsoeuer it shall fall, it will grinde him to powder.
\v 19 ¶ And the chiefe Priests and the Scribes the same houre sought to lay hands on him, and they feared the people: for they perceiued that he had spoken this parable against them.
\v 20 And they watched \add him\add*, and sent foorth spies, which should faine themselues iust men, that they might take holde of his words, that so they might deliuer him vnto the power and authoritie of the gouernour.
\v 21 \x + \xo 20:21 \xt Mat.22.16.\x*\f + \fr 20:21 \ft Or, of a trueth.\f*And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person \add of any\add*, but teachest the way of God truely.
\v 22 Is it lawfull for vs to giue tribute vnto Cesar, or no?
\v 23 But he perceiued their craftines, and said vnto them, Why tempt ye me?
\v 24 \x + \xo 20:24 \xt See Matt. 18.28.\x*Shew me a peny: whose image and superscription hath it? They answered, and said, Cesars.
\v 25 And he said vnto them, Render therefore vnto Cesar the things which be Cesars, and vnto God the things which be Gods.
\v 26 And they could not take holde of his wordes before the people, and they marueiled at his answere, and helde their peace.
\v 27 ¶ \x + \xo 20:27 \xt Mat.22.23.\x*Then came to \add him\add* certaine of the Sadduces (which denie that there is any resurrection) and they asked him,
\v 28 Saying, Master, Moses wrote vnto vs, If any mans brother die, hauing a wife, and hee die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise vp seede vnto his brother.
\v 29 There were therefore seuen brethren, and the first tooke a wife, and died without children.
\v 30 And the second tooke her to wife, and he died childlesse.
\v 31 And the third tooke her, and in like maner the seuen also. And they left no children, and died.
\v 32 Last of all the woman died also.
\v 33 Therefore in the resurrection, whose wife of them is she? for seuen had her to wife.
\v 34 And Iesus answering, said vnto them, The children of this world, marrie, and are giuen in marriage:
\v 35 But they which shall be accompted worthy to obtaine that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marrie, nor are giuen in marriage.
\v 36 Neither can they die any more; for they are equall vnto the Angels, and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.
\v 37 \x + \xo 20:37 \xt Exod.3.6.\x*Now that the dead are raised, euen Moses shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isahac, and the God of Iacob.
\v 38 For he is not a God of the dead, but of the liuing for all liue vnto him.
\v 39 ¶ Then certaine of the Scribes answering, said, Master, Thou hast well said.
\v 40 And after that, they durst not aske him any \add question at all\add*.
\v 41 \x + \xo 20:41 \xt Mat.22.42.\x*And he said vnto them, How say they that Christ is Dauids sonne?
\v 42 And Dauid himselfe saith in the booke of Psalmes, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,
\v 43 Till I make thine enemies thy footestoole.
\v 44 Dauid therefore calleth him, Lord, how is he then his sonne?
\v 45 ¶ Then in the audience of all the people, he said vnto his disciples,
\v 46 \x + \xo 20:46 \xt Mat.23.5.\x*Beware of the Scribes, which desire to walke in long robes, and loue greetings in the markets, and the highest seates in the Synagogues, and the chiefe roumes at feasts:
\v 47 Which deuoure widowes houses and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receiue greater damnation.
\c 21
\iex 1 Christ commendeth the poore widow. 5 Hee foretelleth the destruction of the Temple, and of the citie Hierusalem: 25 The signes also which shall be before the last day. 34 He exhorteth them to be watchfull.

\v 2 \x + \xo 21:2 \xt See Marke 12.42.\x*And hee saw also a certaine poore widow, casting in thither two mites.
\v 3 And he said, Of a truth, I say vnto you, that this poore widow hath cast in more then they all.
\v 4 For all these haue of their abundance cast in vnto the offerings of God, but shee of her penurie hath cast in all the liuing that she had.
\v 5 ¶ \x + \xo 21:5 \xt Mat.24.1.\x*And as some spake of the Temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones, and gifts, he said,
\v 6 \add As for\add* these things which yee behold, the dayes will come, in the which there shal not be left one stone vpon another, that shal not be throwen downe.
\v 7 And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what signe wil there be, when these things shall come to passe?
\v 8 And he said, Take heede that yee be not deceiued: for many shall come in my Name, saying, I am \add Christ\add*, and the time draweth neere: goe yee not therefore after them.
\v 9 But when ye shall heare of wars, and commotions, be not terrified: for these things must first come to passe, but the end \add is\add* not by and by.
\v 10 \x + \xo 21:10 \xt Matt.24.7.\x*Then said he vnto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and kingdome against kingdome:
\v 11 And great earthquakes shall be in diuers places, and famines, and pestilences: and fearefull sights and great signes shall there be from heauen.
\v 12 But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and persecute \add you\add*, deliuering \add you\add* vp to the Synagogues, and into prisons, being brought before Kings and rulers for my Names sake.

\v 21 Then let them which are in Iudea, flee to the mountaines, and let them which are in the midst of it, depart out, and let not them that are in the countreys, enter thereinto.
\v 22 For these be the dayes of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.
\v 23 But woe vnto them that are with childe, and to them that giue sucke in those dayes, for there shalbe great distresse in the land, and wrath vpon this people.
\v 24 And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall bee led away captiue into all nations, and Hierusalem shall be troden downe of the Gentiles, vntill the times of the Gentiles bee fulfilled.

\v 61 And the Lord turned, and looked vpon Peter; and Peter remembred the word of the Lord, how he had said vnto him, Before the cocke crow, thou shalt deny me thrise.
\v 62 And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.
\v 63 ¶ And the men that helde Iesus, mocked him, and smote \add him\add*.
\v 64 And when they had blindfolded him, they stroke him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesie, who is it that smote thee?
\v 65 And many other things blasphemously spake they against him.
\v 66 ¶ \x + \xo 22:66 \xt Mat.27.1.\x*And assoone as it was day, the Elders of the people, & the chiefe Priests and the Scribes came together, and led him into their Councell, saying,
\v 67 Art thou the Christ? Tell vs. And hee said vnto them, If I tell you, you will not beleeue.
\v 68 And if I also aske \add you\add*, you will not answere \add me\add*, nor let me goe.
\v 69 Hereafter shal the sonne of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.
\v 70 \x + \xo 22:70 \xt Mark.14.62.\x*Then said they all, Art thou then the Sonne of God? And hee said vnto them, Ye say that I am.
\v 71 And they said, What need we any further witnesse? For wee our selues haue heard of his owne mouth.

\iex 1 Iesus is accused before Pilate, and sent to Herode. 8 Herode mocketh him. 12 Herode and Pilate are made friends. 13 Barabbas is desired of the people, and is loosed by Pilate, and Iesus is giuen to be crucified. 27 He telleth the women that lament him, the destruction of Hierusalem: 34 Prayeth for his enemies. 39 Two euill doers are crucified with him. 46 His death. 50 His buriall.
\v 1 ¶ And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him vnto Pilate.
\v 2 And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this \add fellow\add* peruerting the nation, and forbidding to giue tribute to Cesar, saying, that he himselfe is Christ a king.
\v 3 \x + \xo 23:3 \xt Matth. 27 11.\x*And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the king of the Iewes? And he answered him, & said, Thou sayest \add it\add*.
\v 4 Then saide Pilate to the chiefe Priests, and \add to\add* the people, I finde no fault in this man.
\v 5 And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth vp the people, teaching thorowout all Iurie, beginning from Galilee to this place.
\v 6 When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilean.
\v 7 And assoone as he knew that hee belonged vnto Herods iurisdiction, hee sent him to Herode, who himselfe also was at Hierusalem at that time.
\v 8 ¶ And when Herode saw Iesus, he was exceeding glad, for hee was desirous to see him of a long \add season\add*, because he had heard many things of him, and hee hoped to haue seene some miracle done by him.
\v 9 Then he questioned with him in many words, but he answered him nothing.
\v 10 And the chiefe Priests and Scribes stood, and vehemently accused him.
\v 11 And Herod with his men of warre set him at naught, and mocked \add him\add*, and arayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him againe to Pilate.
\v 12 ¶ And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together; for before, they were at enmitie betweene themselues.
\v 13 ¶ \x + \xo 23:13 \xt Matth.27 23.\x*And Pilate, when hee had called together the chiefe Priests, and the rulers, and the people,
\v 14 Said vnto them, Ye haue brought this man vnto me, as one that peruerteth the people, and behold, I hauing examined \add him\add* before you, haue found no fault in this man, touching those things whereof ye accuse him.
\v 15 No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him, and loe, nothing worthy of death is done vnto him.
\v 16 I will therefore chastise him, and release \add him\add*.
\v 17 For of necessitie hee must release one vnto them at the Feast.
\v 18 And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this \add man\add*, and release vnto vs Barabbas,
\v 19 Who for a certaine sedition made in the citie, and for murder, was cast in prison.
\v 20 Pilate therefore willing to release Iesus, spake againe to them:
\v 21 But they cried, saying, Crucifie \add him\add*, crucifie him.
\v 22 And hee said vnto them the third time, Why, what euill hath he done? I haue found no cause of death in him, I will therefore chastise him, & let \add him\add* goe.
\v 23 And they were instant with loud voyces, requiring that he might be crucified: and the voyces of them, and of the chiefe Priests preuailed.
\v 24 \f + \fr 23:24 \ft Or, assented.\f*And Pilate gaue sentence that it should be as they required.
\v 25 And he released vnto them, him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired, but he deliuered Iesus to their will.
\v 26 \x + \xo 23:26 \xt Matth.27.32.\x*And as they led him away, they laid hold vpon one Simon a Cyrenian, comming out of the countrey, and on him they laid the crosse, that hee might beare \add it\add* after Iesus.
\v 27 ¶ And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed & lamented him.
\v 28 But Iesus turning vnto them, said, Daughters of Hierusalem, weepe not for me, but weepe for your selues, and for your children.
\v 29 For beholde, the dayes are comming, in the which they shall say, Blessed \add are\add* the barren, and the wombs that neuer bare, and the paps which neuer gaue sucke.
\v 30 \x + \xo 23:30 \xt Isa.2.19. hos.10.8. reuel.6.16.\x*Then shall they begin to say to the mountaines, Fall on vs, and to the hils, Couer vs.
\v 31 \x + \xo 23:31 \xt 1.Pet.4.17.\x*For if they doe these things in a green tree, what shalbe done in the drie?
\v 32 \x + \xo 23:32 \xt Matth.27 38.\x*And there were also two other malefactors led with him, to bee put to death.
\v 33 \f + \fr 23:33 \ft Or, the place of a skull.\f*And when they were come to the place which is called Caluarie, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.
\v 34 ¶ Then said Iesus, Father, forgiue them, for they know not what they doe: And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.
\v 35 And the people stood beholding, & the rulers also with them derided \add him\add*, saying, Hee saued others, let him saue himselfe, if he be Christ, y\sup e\sup* chosen of God.
\v 36 And the souldiers also mocked him, comming to him, and offering him vineger,
\v 37 And saying, If thou be the king of the Iewes, saue thy selfe.
\v 38 And a superscription also was written ouer him in letters of Greeke, and Latin, & Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE IEWES.
\v 39 ¶ And one of y\sup e\sup* malefactors, which were hanged, railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, saue thy selfe and vs.
\v 40 But the other answering, rebuked him, saying, Doest not thou feare God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?
\v 41 And we indeed iustly; for we receiue the due reward of our deeds, but this man hath done nothing amisse.
\v 42 And he said vnto Iesus, Lord, remember me when thou commest into thy kingdome.
\v 43 And Iesus said vnto him, Uerily, I say vnto thee, to day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.
\v 44 \f + \fr 23:44 \ft Or, land.\f*And it was about the sixt houre, and there was a darkenesse ouer all the earth, vntill the ninth houre.
\v 45 And the Sunne was darkened, and the vaile of the temple was rent in the mids.
\v 46 ¶ \x + \xo 23:46 \xt Psal.31.6.\x*And when Iesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: And hauing said thus, he gaue vp the ghost.
\v 47 Now when the Centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.
\v 48 And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.
\v 49 And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood a farre off, beholding these things.
\v 50 ¶ \x + \xo 23:50 \xt Mat.27.57.\x*And behold, \add there was\add* a man named Ioseph, a counseller, and hee was a good man, and a iust.
\v 51 (The same had not consented to the counsell and deede of them) \add he was\add* of Arimathea, a city of the Iewes (who also himselfe waited for the kingdome of God.)
\v 52 This \add man\add* went vnto Pilate, and begged the body of Iesus.
\v 53 And he tooke it downe, and wrapped it in linnen, and layd it in a Sepulchre that was hewen in stone, wherein neuer man before was layd.
\v 54 And that day was the Preparation, and the Sabbath drew on.
\v 55 And the women also which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the Sepulchre, and how his body was layd.
\v 56 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments, and rested the Sabbath day, according to the commandement.

\iex 1 Christs Resurrection is declared by two Angels, to the women that come to the Sepulchre. 9 These report it to others. 13 Christ himselfe appeareth to the two disciples that went to Emmaus: 36 Afterwards he appeareth to the Apostles, and reproueth their vnbeleefe: 47 Giueth them a charge: 49 Promiseth the holy Ghost: 51 And so ascendeth into heauen.
\v 1 ¶ \x + \xo 24:1 \xt Mat.28.1.\x*Now vpon the first \add day\add* of the weeke, very earely in the morning, they came vnto the Sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certaine \add others\add* with them.
\v 2 And they found the stone rolled away from the Sepulchre.
\v 3 And they entred in, and found not the body of the Lord Iesus.
\v 4 And it came to passe, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments.
\v 5 \f + \fr 24:5 \ft Or, him that liueth.\f*And as they were afraid, and bowed downe \add their\add* faces to the earth, they said vnto them, Why seek ye the liuing among the dead?
\v 6 \x + \xo 24:6 \xt Mat.17.23.\x*He is not heere, but is risen: Remember how he spake vnto you when he was yet in Galilee,
\v 7 Saying, The Sonne of man must be deliuered into the hands of sinfull men, and be crucified, and the third day rise againe.
\v 8 And they remembred his words,
\v 9 And returned from the Sepulchre, and told all these things vnto the eleuen, and to all the rest.
\v 10 It was Marie Magdalene, & Ioanna, & Mary \add the mother\add* of Iames, and other \add women that were\add* with them, which tolde these things vnto the Apostles.
\v 11 And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they beleeued them not.
\v 12 \x + \xo 24:12 \xt Iohn 20.6.\x*Then arose Peter, and ranne vnto the Sepulchre, and stowping downe, hee behelde the linnen clothes layd by themselues, and departed, wondering in himselfe at that which was come to passe.
\v 13 ¶ \x + \xo 24:13 \xt Marke 16.12.\x*And behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emaus, which was from Hierusalem \add about\add* threescore furlongs.
\v 14 And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
\v 15 And it came to passe, that while they communed \add together\add*, and reasoned, Iesus himselfe drew neere, and went with them.
\v 16 But their eyes were holden, that they should not know him.
\v 17 And he said vnto them, What maner of communications \add are\add* these that yee haue one to another as yee walke, and are sad?
\v 18 And the one of them, whose name was Cleophas, answering, saide vnto him, Art thou onely a stranger in Hierusalem, and hast not knowen the things which are come to passe there in these dayes?
\v 19 And hee saide vnto them, What things? And they said vnto him, Concerning Iesus of Nazareth, which was a Prophet, mighty in deede and word before God, and all the people.
\v 20 And how the chiefe Priests and our rulers deliuered him to be condemned to death, and haue crucified him.
\v 21 But wee trusted that it had bene hee, which should haue redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.
\v 22 Yea, and certaine women also of our company made vs astonished, which were early at the Sepulchre:
\v 23 And when they found not his bodie, they came, saying, that they had also seene a vision of Angels, which saide that he was aliue.
\v 24 And certaine of them which were with vs, went to the Sepulchre, and found \add it\add* euen so as the women had said, but him they saw not.
\v 25 Then hee saide vnto them, O fooles, and slow of heart to beleeue all that the Prophets haue spoken:
\v 26 Ought not Christ to haue suffered these things, and to enter into his glorie?
\v 27 And beginning at Moses, and all the Prophets, hee expounded vnto them in all the Scriptures, the things concerning himselfe.
\v 28 And they drew nigh vnto the village, whither they went, and hee made as though hee would haue gone further.
\v 29 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with vs, for it is towards euening, and the day is farre spent: And he went in, to tarrie with them.
\v 30 And it came to passe, as hee sate at meate with them, hee tooke bread, and blessed \add it\add*, and brake, and gaue to them.
\v 31 \f + \fr 24:31 \ft Or, ceased to be seene of them.\f*And their eyes were opened, and they knew him, and he vanished out of their sight.
\v 32 And they said one vnto another, Did not our heart burne within vs, while hee talked with vs by the way, and while hee opened to vs the Scriptures?
\v 33 And they rose vp the same houre, and returned to Hierusalem, and found the eleuen gathered together, and them that were with them,
\v 34 Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.
\v 35 And they told what things \add were done\add* in the way, & how he was knowen of them in breaking of bread.
\v 36 ¶ \x + \xo 24:36 \xt Marke 16.14.\x*And as they thus spake, Iesus himselfe stood in the midst of them, and sayeth vnto them, Peace \add bee\add* vnto you.
\v 37 But they were terrified, and afrighted, and supposed that they had seene a spirit.
\v 38 And he said vnto them, Why are yee troubled, and why doe thoughts arise in your hearts?
\v 39 Beholde my hands and my feete, that it is I my selfe: handle me, and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me haue.
\v 40 And when hee had thus spoken, hee shewed them \add his\add* handes and \add his\add* feete.
\v 41 And while they yet beleeued not for ioy, and wondered, hee saide vnto them, Haue ye here any meat?
\v 42 And they gaue him a piece of a broyled fish, and of an hony combe.
\v 43 And he tooke \add it\add*, and did eate before them.
\v 44 And hee said vnto them, These \add are\add* the words which I spake vnto you, while I was yet with you, y\sup t\sup* all things must be fulfilled, which were written \add in\add* the Law of Moses, & \add in\add* the Prophets, and in the Psalmes concerning me.
\v 45 Then opened he their vnderstanding, that they might vnderstand the Scriptures,
\v 46 And said vnto them, Thus it is written, & thus it behoued Christ to suffer, & to rise from the dead the third day:
\v 47 And that repentance and remission of sinnes should be preached in his Name, among all nations, beginning at Hierusalem.
\v 48 And yee are witnesses of these things.
\v 49 ¶ \x + \xo 24:49 \xt Iohn 15.26. actes 1.4.\x*And behold, I send the promise of my Father vpon you: but tarie ye in the citie of Hierusalem, vntill ye be indued with power from on high.
\v 50 ¶ And he led them out as farre as to Bethanie, and hee lift vp his hands, and blessed them.
\v 51 \x + \xo 24:51 \xt Mar.16.19. actes 1.9.\x*And it came to passe, while hee blessed them, hee was parted from them, and caried vp into heauen.
\v 52 And they worshipped him, and returned to Hierusalem, with great ioy:
\v 53 And were continually in the Temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
