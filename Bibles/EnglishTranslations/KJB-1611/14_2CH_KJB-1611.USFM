\v 2 Then Solomon spake vnto all Israel, to the captaines of thousands, and of hundreds, and to the Iudges, and to euery gouernour in all Israel, the chiefe of the fathers.
\v 3 So Solomon and all the Congregation with him, went to the high place that \add was\add* at \x + \xo 1:3 \xt 1.King. 3.4. 1.Chro. 16.39. and 21.29.\x*Gibeon, for there was the Tabernacle of the Congregation of God, which Moses the seruant of the \nd LORD\nd* had made in the wildernesse.

\v 7 ¶ In that night did God appeare vnto Solomon, and saide vnto him; Aske what I shall giue thee.
\v 8 And Solomon saide vnto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy vnto Dauid my father, and hast made \x + \xo 1:8 \xt 1.Chro. 28.5.\x*me to reigne in his stead:
\v 9 Now, O \nd LORD\nd* God, let thy promise vnto Dauid my father be established: \x + \xo 1:9 \xt 1.King.3.9.\x*for thou hast made mee King ouer a people, \f + \fr 1:9 \ft Heb. much as the dust of the earth.\f*like the dust of the earth in multitude.

\v 11 And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisedome and knowledge for thy selfe, that thou mayest iudge my people, ouer whom I haue made thee King:
\v 12 Wisedome and knowledge \add is\add* granted vnto thee, and I will giue thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as \x + \xo 1:12 \xt 1.Chron. 29.25. eccles.2.9. 2.chro. 9.22.\x*none of the kings haue had, that haue beene before thee, neither shall there any after thee haue the like.

\v 15 Now therefore the wheate and the barley, the oyle and the wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send vnto his seruants:

\v 4 And he said, Blessed \add be\add* the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, who hath with his handes fulfilled \add that\add* which he spake with his mouth to my father Dauid, saying,
\v 5 Since the day that I brought foorth my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no citie among all the tribes of Israel to builde an house in, that my Name might be there, neither chose I any man to be a ruler ouer my people Israel:

\v 9 Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house, but thy sonne which shall come foorth out of thy loynes, he shall build the house for my Name.
\v 10 The \nd LORD\nd* therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken: for I am risen vp in the roome of Dauid my father, and am set on the throne of Israel, as the \nd LORD\nd* promised, and haue built the house for the Name of the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel.

\v 14 \x + \xo 6:14 \xt Exod.15.11.\x*And said, O \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, \add there is\add* no God like thee in the heauen, nor in the earth, which keepest couenant, and \add shewest\add* mercy vnto thy seruants, that walke before thee with all their hearts,

\v 13 And Micaiah said, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liueth, euen what my God saith, that will I speake.
\v 14 And when hee was come to the king, the king sayd vnto him, Micaiah, shall we goe to Ramoth Gilead to battell, or shall I fobreare? and he sayd, Goe yee vp, and prosper, and they shall be deliuered into your hand.
\v 15 And the king sayd to him, Howe many times shall I adiure thee, that thou say nothing but the truth to me, in the name of the \nd LORD\nd*?
\v 16 Then he sayd, I did see all Israel scattered vpon the mountaines, as sheepe that haue no shepheard: and the \nd LORD\nd* sayd, These haue no master, let them returne \add therefore\add*, euery man to his house in peace.

\v 19 And the \nd LORD\nd* sayd, Who shall entise Ahab king of Israel, that hee may goe vp and fall at Ramoth Gilead? And one spake, saying after this maner, and another saying after that maner.
\v 20 \x + \xo 18:20 \xt Iob.1.6.\x*Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the \nd LORD\nd*, and sayd, I will entise him. And the \nd LORD\nd* sayd vnto him, Wherewith?

\v 22 Nowe therefore behold, the \nd LORD\nd* hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the \nd LORD\nd* hath spoken euill against thee.

Then Athaliah rent her clothes, and said, Treason, treason.
\v 14 Then Iehoiada the Priest brought out the captaines of hundreds, that were set ouer the host, and said vnto them, Haue her foorth of the ranges: and who so followeth her, let him bee slaine with the sword. For the Priest said; Slay her not in the house of the \nd LORD\nd*.

\v 6 \x + \xo 24:6 \xt Exod. 30.12,13,14.\x*And the king called for Iehoiada the chiefe, and saide vnto him, Why hast thou not required of the Leuites to bring in out of Iudah and out of Ierusalem, the collection, according to the commandement of Moses the seruant of the \nd LORD\nd*, and of the Congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of Witnesse?
\v 7 For the sonnes of Athaliah that wicked woman, had broken vp the house of God, and also all the dedicate things of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, did they bestow vpon Baalim.
\v 8 And at the kings commandement they made a chest, and set it without, at the gate of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*.

\v 10 And all the Princes and all the people reioyced, and brought in, and cast into the chest, vntill they had made an ende.
\v 11 Now it came to passe that at what time the chest was brought vnto the kings office, by the hand of the Leuites: and when they sawe that \add there was\add* much money: the kings Scribe, and the high priests officer, came and emptied the chest, and tooke it, and caried it to his place againe. Thus they did day by day, and gathered money in abundance.
\v 12 And the king and Iehoiada gaue it to such as did the worke of the seruice of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and hired Masons and carpenters to repaire the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and also such as wrought yron and brasse to mend the house of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 13 \f + \fr 24:13 \ft Hebr. the healing went vp vpon the worke.\f*So the workemen wrought, and the worke was perfected by them: and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened it.

\v 15 ¶ But Iehoiada waxed old, and was full of dayes when hee died: an hundred and thirtie yeeres olde was hee when hee died.
\v 16 And they buried him in the citie of Dauid among the kings, because he had done good in Israel, both towards God, and towards his house.
\v 17 Now after the death of Iehoiada, came the Princes of Iudah, and made obeysance to the king: then the king hearkened vnto them.
\v 18 And they left the house of the \nd LORD\nd* God of their fathers, and serued groues and idols: and wrath came vpon Iudah and Ierusalem for this their trespasse.
\v 19 Yet hee sent prophets to them to bring them againe vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, and they testified against them: but they would not giue eare.
\v 20 \f + \fr 24:20 \ft Heb. clothed.\f*And the spirit of God came vpon Zechariah the sonne of Iehoiada the priest, which stood aboue the people, and said vnto them: Thus saith God, Why transgresse yee the commandements of the \nd LORD\nd*, that yee cannot prosper? Because yee haue forsaken the \nd LORD\nd*, he hath also forsaken you.
\v 21 And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at the commandement of the king, in the court of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 22 Thus Ioash the king remembred not the kindnesse which Iehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his sonne: and when he died, he said, The \nd LORD\nd* looke vpon \add it\add*, and require \add it\add*.

\v 24 For the armie of the Syrians came with a small companie of men, and the \nd LORD\nd* deliuered a very great hoste into their hand, because they had forsaken the \nd LORD\nd* God of their fathers: so they executed iudgement against Ioash.
\v 25 And when they were departed from him (for they left him in great diseases) his owne seruants conspired against him, for the blood of the sonnes of Iehoiada the Priest, and slewe him on his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the citie of Dauid, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the Kings.

\v 5 ¶ Moreouer, Amaziah gathered Iudah together, and made them Captaines ouer thousands, and captaines ouer hundreds, according to the houses of \add their\add* fathers, throughout all Iudah and Beniamin: And he numbred them from twentie yeeres olde and aboue, and found them three hundred thousand choice \add men, able\add* to goe foorth to warre, that could handle speare and shield.
\v 6 Hee hired also an hundred thousand mightie men of valour, out of Israel, for an hundred talents of siluer.
\v 7 But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not the armie of Israel goe with thee: for the \nd LORD\nd* \add is\add* not with Israel, \add to wit, with\add* all the children of Ephraim.
\v 8 But if thou wilt goe, doe \add it\add*, bee strong for the battell: God shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to helpe, and to cast downe.

Wherfore their anger was greatly kindled against Iudah, and they returned home in great anger.
\v 11 ¶ And Amaziah strengthened himselfe, and ledde foorth his people, and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of Seir, ten thousand.
\v 12 And \add other\add* ten thousand \add left\add* aliue, did the children of Iudah cary away captiue, and brought them vnto the top of the rocke, and cast them downe from the top of the rocke, that they all were broken in pieces.

\v 14 ¶ Now it came to passe, after that Amaziah was come from the slaughter of the Edomites, that hee brought the gods of the children of Seir, and set them vp \add to be\add* his gods, and bowed down himselfe before them, and burned incense vnto them.
\v 15 Wherfore the anger of the \nd LORD\nd* was kindled against Amaziah, and hee sent vnto him a Prophet, which said vnto him, Why hast thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not deliuer their owne people out of thine hand?
\v 16 \f + \fr 25:16 \ft Heb. counselled.\f*And it came to passe as hee talked with him, that \add the king\add* said vnto him, Art thou made of the Kings counsell? forbeare; why shouldest thou be smitten?

\iex 1 Ahaz reigning very wickedly, is greatly afflicted by the Syrians. 6 Iudah being captiuated by the Israelites, is sent home by the counsell of Oded the Prophet. 16 Ahaz sending for aide to Assyria, is not helped thereby. 22 In his distresse, he groweth more idolatrous. 26 He dying, Hezekiah succeedeth him.

\v 4 Hee sacrificed also, and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hils, and vnder euery greene tree.

\v 8 And the children of Israel caried away captiue of their brethren, two hundred thousand, women, sonnes and daughters, and tooke also away much spoile from them, and brought the spoile to Samaria.
\v 9 But a Prophet of the \nd LORD\nd* was there, whose name \add was\add* Oded: and hee went out before the hoste \add that\add* came to Samaria, and said vnto them, Behold, because the \nd LORD\nd* God of your fathers was wroth with Iudah, he hath deliuered them into your hand, and yee haue slaine them in a rage that reacheth vp vnto heauen.
\v 10 And now ye purpose to keepe vnder the children of Iudah and Ierusalem for bondmen, and bondwomen vnto you: But are there not with you, euen with you, sinnes against the \nd LORD\nd* your God?
\v 11 Now heare me therefore, and deliuer the captiues againe, which ye haue taken captiue of your brethren: for the fierce wrath of God \add is\add* vpon you.
\v 12 Then certeine of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah the sonne of Iohanan, Berechiah the sonne of Meshillemoth, and Iehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the sonne of Hadlai, stood vp against them that came from the warre,
\v 13 And said vnto them, Ye shall not bring in the captiues hither: for whereas wee haue offended against the \nd LORD\nd* \add already\add*, ye intend to adde \add more\add* to our sinnes and to our trespasse: for our trespasse is great, and \add there is\add* fierce wrath against Israel.
\v 14 So the armed men left the captiues, and the spoile before the Princes, and all the congregation.
\v 15 \x + \xo 28:15 \xt Deut.34.3.\x*And the men which were expressed by name, rose vp and tooke the captiues, and with the spoile clothed all that were naked among them, and arayed them, and shod them, and gaue them to eate and to drinke, and anointed them, and caried all the feeble of them vpon asses, and brought them to Iericho, the city of palme-trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.
\v 16 ¶ At that time did king Ahaz send vnto the kings of Assyria to helpe him.

\v 18 The Philistines also had inuaded the cities of the low-countrey, and of the South of Iudah, and had taken Beth-shemesh, and Aialon, and Gedetoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also, and the villages thereof: and they dwelt there.
\v 19 For the \nd LORD\nd* brought Iudah low, because of Ahaz king of Israel; for he made Iudah naked, and transgressed sore against the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 20 And Tilgath-Pilneser king of Assyria came vnto him, and distressed him, but strengthened him not.
\v 21 For Ahaz tooke away a portion \add out\add* of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and \add out\add* of the house of the King, and of the Princes, and gaue \add it\add* vnto the King of Assyria: but he helped him not.

\v 23 \f + \fr 28:23 \ft Heb. Darmesek.\f*For he sacrificed vnto the gods of Damascus, which smote him: and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria helpe them, \add therefore\add* will I sacrifice to them, that they may helpe me: but they were the ruine of him, and of all Israel.
\v 24 And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God, and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut vp the doores of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and hee made him altars in euery corner of Ierusalem.

\v 3 ¶ He, in the first yere of his reigne, in the first moneth, opened the doores of the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and repaired them.
\v 4 And hee brought in the Priests, and the Leuites, and gathered them together into the East street,

\v 17 Now they began on the first \add day\add* of the first moneth to sanctifie, and on the eight day of the moneth, came they to the porch of the \nd LORD\nd*. So they sanctified the house of the \nd LORD\nd* in eight dayes, and in the sixteenth day of the first moneth, they made an end.
\v 18 Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We haue cleansed all the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and the altar of burnt offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the shew-bread table, with all the vessels thereof.
\v 19 Moreouer all the vessels which king Ahaz in his reigne did cast away in his transgression, haue we prepared and sanctified, and behold, they \add are\add* before the altar of the \nd LORD\nd*.

\v 30 Moreouer Hezekiah the king and the Princes, commanded the Leuites to sing praise vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, with the words of Dauid, and of Asaph the Seer: and they sang praises with gladnes, and they bowed their heads and worshipped.
\v 31 \f + \fr 29:31 \ft Or, filled your hand.\f*Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye haue consecrated your selues vnto the \nd LORD\nd*: come neere and bring sacrifices, and thanke-offerings into the house of the \nd LORD\nd*. And the congregation brought in sacrifices, and thank-offrings, and as many as were of a free heart, burnt offerings.
\v 32 And the number of the burnt offerings which the congregation brought, was threescore and ten bullockes, an hundred rammes, \add and\add* two hundred lambs: all these \add were\add* for a burnt offring to the \nd LORD\nd*.

\iex 1 Hezekiah proclaimeth a solemne Passeouer on the second moneth, for Iudah and Israel. 13 The assembly hauing destroyed the altars of idolatry, keepe the feast fourteene dayes. 27 The Priests and Leuites blesse the people.
\v 1 ¶ And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Iudah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the \nd LORD\nd* at Ierusalem, to keepe the Passeouer vnto the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel.
\v 2 \x + \xo 30:2 \xt Num.19.11.\x*For the king had taken counsell, and his Princes, and all the congregation in Ierusalem, to keepe the Passeouer in the second moneth.
\v 3 For they could not keepe it at that time, because the Priests had not sanctified themselues sufficiently, neither had the people gathered themselues together to Ierusalem.
\v 4 \f + \fr 30:4 \ft Heb. was right in the eyes of the King.\f*And the thing pleased the king, and all the Congregation.
\v 5 So they established a decree, to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba euen to Dan, that they should come to keep the Passeouer vnto the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel at Ierusalem: for they had not done \add it\add* of a long \add time in such sort\add*, as it was written.

\v 7 And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which trespassed against the \nd LORD\nd* God of their fathers, \add who\add* therefore gaue them vp to desolation, as ye see.

\v 10 So the Posts passed from citie to citie, through the countrey of Ephraim and Manasseh, euen vnto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorne, and mocked them.
\v 11 Neuerthelesse, diuers of Asher, and Manasseh, and of Zebulun, humbled themselues, and came to Ierusalem.
\v 12 Also in Iudah, the hand of God was to giue them one heart to doe the commandement of the king and of the Princes, by the word of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 13 ¶ And there assembled at Ierusalem much people, to keepe the feast of vnleauened bread in the second moneth, a very great congregation.
\v 14 \x + \xo 30:14 \xt Chap.28.24.\x*And they arose and tooke away the altars that \add were\add* in Ierusalem, and all the altars for incense tooke they away, and cast \add them\add* into the brooke Kidron.
\v 15 Then they killed the Passeouer on the fourteenth \add day\add* of the second moneth: and the Priests and the Leuites were ashamed, and sanctified themselues, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 16 \f + \fr 30:16 \ft Heb. their standing.\f*And they stood in their place after their maner, according to the Law of Moses the man of God: The priests sprinckled the blood, \add which they receiued\add* of the hand of the Leuites.
\v 17 For \add there were\add* many in the Congregation that were not sanctified: therefore the Leuites had the charge of the killing of the Passeouers for euery one \add that was\add* not cleane, to sanctifie \add them\add* vnto the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 18 For a multitude of the people, \add euen\add* many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselues: yet did they eate the Passeouer otherwise then it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying; The good \nd LORD\nd* pardon euery one,
\v 19 \add That\add* prepareth his heart to seeke God, the \nd LORD\nd* God of his fathers, though hee be not \add cleansed\add* according to the purification of the Sanctuary.
\v 20 And the \nd LORD\nd* hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.

\v 22 \f + \fr 30:22 \ft Hebr. to the heart of all &c.\f*And Hezekiah spake comfortably vnto all the Leuites, that taught the good knowledge of the \nd LORD\nd*: and they did eate throughout the feast, seuen dayes, offering peace-offerings, and making confession to the \nd LORD\nd* God of their fathers.
\v 23 And the whole assembly tooke counsel to keepe other seuen dayes: and they kept \add other\add* seuen dayes with gladnesse.
\v 24 \f + \fr 30:24 \ft Heb. lifted vp or offred.\f*For Hezekiah king of Iudah did giue to the Congregation, a thousand bullockes, and seuen thousand sheep: and the Princes gaue to the Congregation a thousand bullocks, and ten thousand sheepe, and a great number of Priests sanctified themselues.
\v 25 And all the Congregation of Iudah, with the Priests and the Leuites, and all the Congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Iudah, reioyced.
\v 26 So there was great ioy in Ierusalem: for since the time of Solomon the sonne of Dauid King of Israel, \add there was\add* not the like in Ierusalem.

Then all the children of Israel returned euery man to his possession into their owne cities.
