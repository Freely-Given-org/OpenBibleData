\v 1 ¶ The beginning of the Gospel of Iesus Christ, the Sonne of God,
\v 2 As it is written in the Prophets, \x + \xo 1:2 \xt Mala. 3.1.\x*Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.
\v 3 \x + \xo 1:3 \xt Esa. 40.3. luke 3.4. iohn 1.23.\x*The voice of one crying in the wildernesse, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
\v 4 \x + \xo 1:4 \xt Matt.3.1.\x*Iohn did baptize in the wildernesse, and preach the baptisme of repentance, \f + \fr 1:4 \ft Or, vnto.\f*for the remission of sinnes.
\v 5 \x + \xo 1:5 \xt Matt. 3.5.\x*And there went out vnto him all the land of Iudea, and they of Ierusalem, and were all baptized of him in the riuer of Iordane, cofessing their sinnes.
\v 6 And Iohn was \x + \xo 1:6 \xt Matt. 3.4.\x*clothed with camels haire, and with a girdle of a skin about his loines: and he did eat locusts and wilde honie,
\v 7 And preached, saying, There commeth one mightier then I after me, the latchet of whose shooes I am not worthy to stoupe downe, and vnloose.
\v 8 I indeed haue baptized you with water: but hee shall baptize you with the holy Ghost.
\v 9 \x + \xo 1:9 \xt Matth. 3.13.\x*And it came to passe in those daies, that Iesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of Iohn in Iordane.
\v 10 And straightway comming vp out of the water, hee saw the heauens \f + \fr 1:10 \ft Or, clouen, or rent.\f*opened, and the Spirit like a doue descending vpon him.
\v 11 And there came a voice from heauen, \add saying\add*, Thou art my beloued Sonne, in whom I am well pleased.
\v 12 \x + \xo 1:12 \xt Matt. 4.1.\x*And immediately the Spirit driueth him into the wildernesse.
\v 13 And he was there in the wildernesse fourtie daies tempted of Satan, and was with the wildbeasts, and the Angels ministred vnto him.
\v 14 Now after that Iohn was put in prison, \x + \xo 1:14 \xt Matth.4.12.\x*Iesus came into Galilee, preaching the Gospell of the kingdome of God,
\v 15 And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdome of God is at hand: repent ye, and beleeue the Gospell.
\v 16 \x + \xo 1:16 \xt Matth.4.18.\x*Now as he walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the Sea (for they were fishers.)
\v 17 And Iesus said vnto them, Come ye after me; and I will make you to become fishers of men.
\v 18 And straightway they forsooke their nets, and followed him.
\v 19 And when hee had gone a little further thence, hee saw Iames the sonne of Zebedee, and Iohn his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.
\v 20 And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired seruants, and went after him.
\v 21 \x + \xo 1:21 \xt Matth.4.13.\x*And they went into Capernaum, and straightway on the Sabbath day he entred into the Synagogue, and taught.
\v 22 \x + \xo 1:22 \xt Matth.7.28.\x*And they were astonished at his doctrine: for hee taught them as one that had authority, and not as the Scribes.
\v 23 \x + \xo 1:23 \xt Luke 4.33.\x*And there was in their Synagogue a man with an vncleane spirit, and he cried out,
\v 24 Saying, Let \add vs\add* alone, what haue we to doe with thee, thou Iesus of Nazareth? Art thou come to destroy \add vs\add*? I know thee who thou art, the holy One of God.
\v 25 And Iesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.
\v 26 And when the vncleane spirit had torne him, and cried with a lowd voice, he came out of him.
\v 27 And they were all amased, insomuch that they questioned among themselues, saying, What thing is this? What new doctrine \add is\add* this? For with authoritie commandeth he euen the vncleane spirits, and they doe obey him.
\v 28 And immediatly his fame spread abroad throughout al the region round about Galilee.
\v 29 \x + \xo 1:29 \xt Matth.8.14.\x*And forth with, when they were come out of the Synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon, and Andrew, with Iames and Iohn.
\v 30 But Simons wiues mother lay sicke of a feuer: and anone they tell him of her.
\v 31 And he came and tooke her by the hand, and lift her vp, and immediately the feuer left her, and she ministred vnto them.
\v 32 And at euen, when the Sunne did set, they brought vnto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with diuels:
\v 33 And all the citie was gathered together at the doore.
\v 34 And he healed many that were sicke of diuers diseases, and cast out many deuils, and suffered not the deuils \f + \fr 1:34 \ft Or, to say that they knew him.\f*to speake, because they knew him.
\v 35 And in the morning, rising vp a great while before day, hee went out, and departed into a solitarie place, and there prayed.
\v 36 And Simon, and they that were with him, followed after him:
\v 37 And when they had found him, they said vnto him, All \add men\add* seek for thee.
\v 38 And he said vnto them, Let vs goe into y\sup e\sup* next townes, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I foorth.
\v 39 And he preached in their Synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out deuils.
\v 40 \x + \xo 1:40 \xt Matth.8.2\x*And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling downe to him, and saying vnto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me cleane.
\v 41 And Iesus mooued with compassion, put foorth \add his\add* hand, and touched him, and saith vnto him, I will, be thou cleane.
\v 42 And assoone as he had spoken, immediately the leprosie departed from him, and he was cleansed.
\v 43 And he straitly charged him, and forth with sent him away,
\v 44 And saith vnto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but goe thy way, shew thy selfe to the Priest, and offer for thy clensing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony vnto them.
\v 45 \x + \xo 1:45 \xt Luke 5.15.\x*But he went out, and beganne to publish \add it\add* much, and to blase abroad the matter: insomuch that Iesus could no more openly enter into the citie, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from euery quarter.

\iex 1 Christ healeth one sicke of the palsie, 14 calleth Matthew from the receit of Custome, 15 eateth with Publicanes, and sinners, 18 excuseth his disciples for not fasting, 23 and for plucking the eares of corne on the Sabbath day.
\v 1 ¶ And againe \x + \xo 2:1 \xt Matt. 9.1.\x*hee entred into Capernaum after \add some\add* dayes, and it was noysed that he was in the house.
\v 2 And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no roome to receiue \add them\add*, no not so much as about the doore: and he preached the word vnto them.
\v 3 And they come vnto him, bringing one sicke of the palsie, which was borne of foure.
\v 4 And when they could not come nigh vnto him for preasse, they vncouered the roofe where he was: and when they had broken \add it\add* vp, they let downe the bed wherin the sick of the palsie lay.
\v 5 When Iesus saw their faith, hee said vnto the sicke of the palsie, Sonne, thy sinnes be forgiuen thee.
\v 6 But there were certaine of the Scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,
\v 7 Why doeth this \add man\add* thus speake blasphemies? \x + \xo 2:7 \xt Iob 14.4. esay 43.25.\x*Who can forgiue sinnes but God onely?
\v 8 And immediatly, when Iesus perceiued in his Spirit, that they so reasoned within themselues, he said vnto them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?
\v 9 Whether is it easier to say to the sicke of the palsie, \add Thy\add* sinnes be forgiuen thee: or to say, Arise, and take vp thy bed and walke?
\v 10 But that yee may know that the Sonne of man hath power on earth to forgiue sinnes, (Hee saith to the sicke of the palsie,)
\v 11 I say vnto thee, Arise, & take vp thy bed, & goe thy way into thine house.
\v 12 And immediatly he arose, tooke vp the bed, and went foorth before them all, insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, Wee neuer saw it on this fashion.
\v 13 And he went foorth againe by the sea side, and all the multitude resorted vnto him, and he taught them.
\v 14 \x + \xo 2:14 \xt Matt. 9.9.\x*And as he passed by, he saw Leui the \add son\add* of Alpheus sitting \f + \fr 2:14 \ft Or, at the place where the Custome are receive,\f*at the receit of Custome, and said vnto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.
\v 15 And it came to passe, that as Iesus sate at meate in his house, many Publicanes and sinners sate also together with Iesus and his disciples: for there were many, & they followed him.
\v 16 And when the Scribes and Pharisees saw him eate with Publicanes and sinners, they said vnto his disciples, How is it that hee eateth and drinketh with Publicanes and sinners?
\v 17 When Iesus heard \add it\add*, he saith vnto them, They that are whole, haue no need of the Physition, but they that are sicke: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
\v 18 \x + \xo 2:18 \xt Matth. 9.14 luke 5.32.\x*And the disciples of Iohn, and of the Pharisees vsed to fast; and they come, and say vnto him, Why doe the disciples of Iohn, and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?
\v 19 And Iesus said vnto them, Can the children of the bride-chamber fast, while the Bridegrome is with them? As long as they haue the Bridegrome with them, they cannot fast.
\v 20 But the dayes will come, when the Bridegrome shall bee taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those dayes.
\v 21 No man also soweth a piece of \f + \fr 2:21 \ft Or, raw, or vnwrought.\f*new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it vp, taketh away from the old, & the rent is made worse.
\v 22 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles, else the new wine doeth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will bee marred: But new wine must bee put into new bottles.
\v 23 \x + \xo 2:23 \xt Matt. 12.1.\x*And it came to passe, that he went thorow the corne fields on the Sabbath day, & his disciples began as they went, to plucke the eares of corne.
\v 24 And the Pharisees saide vnto him, Behold, why do they on the Sabbath day that which is not lawfull?
\v 25 And he said vnto them, Haue ye neuer read what Dauid did, when hee had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him?
\v 26 How hee went into the house of God in the dayes of Abiathar the high Priest, and did eate the Shew-bread, which is not lawfull to eate, but for the Priests, and gaue also to them which were with him?
\v 27 And hee said vnto them, The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath:
\v 28 Therefore the Sonne of man is Lord also of the Sabbath.

\iex 1 Christ healeth the withered hand, 10 and many other infirmities: 11 Rebuketh the vncleane spirits: 13 Chooseth his twelue Apostles: 22 Conuinceth the blasphemie of casting out deuils by Beelzebub: 31 and sheweth who are his brother, sister and mother.
\v 1 ¶ \x + \xo 3:1 \xt Mat.12.9\x*And he entred againe into the Synagogue, and there was a man there which had a withered hand:
\v 2 And they watched him, whether hee would heale him on the Sabbath day, that they might accuse him.
\v 3 And he saith vnto the man which had the withered hand, Stand forth.
\v 4 And hee saith vnto them, Is it lawfull to doe good on the Sabbath dayes, or to doe euill? to saue life, or to kill? but they held their peace.
\v 5 \f + \fr 3:5 \ft Or, blindnesse.\f*And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieued for the hardnesse of their hearts, He saith vnto the man, Stretch foorth thine hand. And he stretched \add it\add* out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.
\v 6 And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway tooke counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.
\v 7 But Iesus withdrew himselfe with his disciples to the Sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Iudea,
\v 8 And from Hierusalem, and from Idumea, and \add from\add* beyond Iordane, and they about Tyre & Sydon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came vnto him.
\v 9 And he spake to his disciples that a small ship should wait on him, because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.
\v 10 \f + \fr 3:10 \ft Or, rushed\f*For he had healed many, insomuch that they preassed vpon him, for to touch him, as many as had plagues.
\v 11 And vncleane spirits, when they saw him, fell downe before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Sonne of God.
\v 12 And he straitly charged them, that they should not make him knowen.
\v 13 \x + \xo 3:13 \xt Matt.10.1\x*And he goeth vp into a mountaine, and calleth \add vnto him\add* whom he would: and they came \add vnto him\add*.
\v 14 And he ordeined twelue, that they should be with him, and that hee might send them foorth to preach:
\v 15 And to haue power to heale sickenesses, and to cast out deuils.
\v 16 And Simon he surnamed Peter.
\v 17 And Iames the sonne of Zebedee, and Iohn the brother of Iames (and he surnamed them Boanerges, which is, The sonnes of thunder.)
\v 18 And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and Iames the sonne of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Canaanite,
\v 19 \f + \fr 3:19 \ft Or, home.\f*And Iudas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house.
\v 20 And the multitude commeth together againe, so that they could not so much as eate bread.
\v 21 \f + \fr 3:21 \ft Or, kinsemen.\f*And when his friends heard \add of it\add*, they went out to lay hold on him, for they said, He is beside himselfe.
\v 22 ¶ \x + \xo 3:22 \xt Mat.9.34\x*And the Scribes which came downe from Hierusalem, said, He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of the deuils, casteth he out deuils.
\v 23 And he called them \add vnto him\add*, and said vnto them in parables, Howe can Satan cast out Satan?
\v 24 And if a kingdome be diuided against it selfe, that kingdome cannot stand.
\v 25 And if a house be diuided against it selfe, that house cannot stand.
\v 26 And if Satan rise vp against himselfe, and be diuided, hee cannot stand, but hath an end.
\v 27 No man can enter into a strong mans house, and spoile his goods, except he will first bind the strong man, and then he will spoile his house.
\v 28 \x + \xo 3:28 \xt Matt.12.31.\x*Uerely I say vnto you, All sinnes shalbe forgiuen vnto the sonnes of men, and blasphemies, wherewith soeuer they shall blaspheme:
\v 29 But he that shal blaspheme against the holy Ghost, hath neuer forgiuenesse, but is in danger of eternall damnation.
\v 30 Because they said, He hath an vncleane spirit.
\v 31 ¶ \x + \xo 3:31 \xt Mat.13.46.\x*There came then his brethren, and his mother, and standing without, sent vnto him, calling him.
\v 32 And the multitude sate about him and they said vnto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seeke for thee.
\v 33 And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, or my brethren?
\v 34 And he looked round about on them which sate about him, and saide, Behold my mother and my brethren.
\v 35 For whosoeuer shall doe the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.

\iex 1 The parable of the sower, 14 and the meaning thereof. 21 We must communicate the light of our knowledge to others. 26 The parable of the seede growing secretly, 30 and of the Mustard seede. 35 Christ stilleth the tempest on the Sea.
\v 1 ¶ \x + \xo 4:1 \xt Matth.13.1.\x*And he beganne againe to teach by the Sea side: and there was gathered vnto him a great multitude, so that he entred into a ship, and sate in the Sea: and the whole multitude was by the Sea on the land.
\v 2 And he taught them many things by parables, and said vnto them in his doctrine,
\v 3 Hearken, Behold, there went out a sower to sow:
\v 4 And it came to passe as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and the foules of the aire came, & deuoured it vp.
\v 5 And some fell on stonie ground, where it had not much earth: and immediately it sprang vp, because it had no depth of earth.
\v 6 But when the Sunne was vp, it was scorched, and because it had no roote, it withered away.
\v 7 And some fell among thornes, and the thornes grew vp, and choked it, and it yeelded no fruite.
\v 8 And other fell on good ground, and did yeeld fruite that sprang vp, and increased, and brought foorth some thirtie, & some sixtie, & some an hundred.
\v 9 And he said vnto them, He that hath eares to heare, let him heare.
\v 10 And when hee was alone, they that were about him, with the twelue, asked of him the parable.
\v 11 And he said vnto them, Unto you it is giuen to know the mystery of the kingdome of God: but vnto them that are without, all \add these\add* things are done in parables:
\v 12 \x + \xo 4:12 \xt Matth.13.14.\x*That seeing they may see, and not perceiue, and hearing they may heare, and not vnderstand, lest at any time they should be conuerted, and \add their\add* sinnes should be forgiuen them.
\v 13 And he said vnto them, Know ye not this parable? And how then will you know all parables?
\v 14 ¶ The Sower soweth the word.
\v 15 And these are they by the way side, where the word is sowen, but when they haue heard, Satan commeth immediately, and taketh away the word that was sowen in their hearts.
\v 16 And these are they likewise which are sowen on stonie ground, who when they haue heard the word, immediately receiue it with gladnesse:
\v 17 And haue no roote in themselues, and so endure but for a time: afterward when affliction or persecution ariseth for the words sake, immediately they are offended.
\v 18 And these are they which are sowen among thorns: such as heare the word,
\v 19 \x + \xo 4:19 \xt 1.Tim.6.17.\x*And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulnesse of riches, and the lusts of other things entring in, choke the word, and it becommeth vnfruitfull.
\v 20 And these are they which are sowen on good ground, such as heare the word, and receiue \add it\add*, & bring foorth fruit, some thirty fold, some sixtie, and some an hundred.
\v 21 ¶ \x + \xo 4:21 \xt Matth.5.15.\x*\x + \xo 4:21 \xt The word, in the originall, signifieth a lesse measure as Mat. 5.15.\x*And he said vnto them, Is a candle brought to be put vnder a bushell, or vnder a bed? & not to be set on a candlesticke?
\v 22 \x + \xo 4:22 \xt Matth.10.26.\x*For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested: neither was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.
\v 23 If any man haue eares to heare, let him heare.
\v 24 \x + \xo 4:24 \xt Matth.7.2.\x*And he said vnto them, Take heed what you heare: With what measure ye mete, it shalbe measured to you: And vnto you that heare, shal more be giuen.
\v 25 \x + \xo 4:25 \xt Matth.13.12.\x*For he that hath, to him shall be giuen: and he that hath not, from him shall be taken, euen that which he hath.
\v 26 ¶ And he said, So is the kingdome of God, as if a man should cast seede into the ground,
\v 27 And should sleepe, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring, and grow vp, he knoweth not how.
\v 28 For the earth bringeth foorth fruite of herselfe, first the blade, then the eare, after that the full corne in the eare.
\v 29 \f + \fr 4:29 \ft Or, ripe.\f*But when the fruite is brought foorth, immediately he putteth in the sickle, because the haruest is come.
\v 30 ¶ \x + \xo 4:30 \xt Matth.13.31.\x*And he said, Wherunto shal we liken the kingdome of God? Or with what comparison shall we compare it?
\v 31 \add It is\add* like a graine of mustard seed: which when it is sowen in the earth, is lesse then all the seedes that be in the earth.
\v 32 But when it is sowen, it groweth vp, and becommeth greater then all herbes, & shooteth out great branches, so that the fowles of the aire may lodge vnder the shadow of it.
\v 33 \x + \xo 4:33 \xt Matth.13.34.\x*And with many such parables spake hee the word vnto them, as they were able to heare \add it\add*.
\v 34 But without a parable spake he not vnto them, and when they were alone, hee expounded all things to his disciples.
\v 35 \x + \xo 4:35 \xt Matth.8.23.\x*And the same day, when the Euen was come, he saith vnto them, Let vs passe ouer vnto the other side.
\v 36 And when they had sent away the multitude, they tooke him, euen as he was in the ship, and there were also with him other litle ships.
\v 37 And there arose a great storme of wind, and the waues beat into the ship, so that it was now full.
\v 38 And he was in the hinder part of the ship asleepe on a pillow: and they awake him, and say vnto him, Master, carest thou not, that we perish?
\v 39 And hee arose, and rebuked the winde, and said vnto the sea, Peace, be still: and the winde ceased, and there was a great calme.
\v 40 And he said vnto them, Why are ye so fearefull? How is it that you haue no faith?
\v 41 And they feared exceedingly, and saide one to another, What maner of man is this, that euen the winde and the sea obey him?

\iex 1 Christ deliuering the possessed of the Legion of deuils, 13 They enter into the swine, 25 Hee healeth the woman of the bloody issue, 35 and raiseth from death Iairus his daughter.
\v 1 ¶ \x + \xo 5:1 \xt Matth. 8.28.\x*And they came ouer vnto the other side of the sea, into the countrey of the Gadarenes.
\v 2 And when hee was come out of the ship, immediatly there met him out of the tombes, a man with an vncleane spirit,
\v 3 Who had \add his\add* dwelling among the tombs, and no man could binde him, no not with chaines:
\v 4 Because that hee had bene often bound with fetters and chaines, and the chaines had bene plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any \add man\add* tame him.
\v 5 And alwayes night and day, hee was in the mountaines, and in the tombes, crying, and cutting himselfe with stones.
\v 6 But when hee saw Iesus afarre off, he came and worshipped him,
\v 7 And cried with a lowd voice, and said, What haue I to doe with thee, Iesus, \add thou\add* Sonne of the most high God? I adiure thee by God, that thou torment me not.
\v 8 (For he said vnto him, Come out of the man, \add thou\add* vncleane spirit.)
\v 9 And he asked him, What \add is\add* thy name? And hee answered, saying, My name \add is\add* Legion: for we are many.
\v 10 And hee besought him much, that he would not send them away out of the countrey.
\v 11 Now there was there nigh vnto the mountaines a great herd of swine, feeding.
\v 12 And all the deuils besought him, saying, Send vs into the swine, that we may enter into them.
\v 13 And forthwith Iesus gaue them leaue. And the vncleane spirits went out, and entred into the swine, and the herd ranne violently downe a steepe place into the sea (they were about two thousand) and were choked in the sea.
\v 14 And they that fed the swine fled, and tolde \add it\add* in the citie, and in the countrey. And they went out to see what it was that was done.
\v 15 And they come to Iesus, and see him that was possessed with the deuill, and had the Legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right minde: and they were afraid.
\v 16 And they that saw \add it\add*, tolde them how it befell to him that was possessed with the deuill, and \add also\add* concerning the swine.
\v 17 And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.
\v 18 And when hee was come into the ship, he that had bene possessed with the deuill prayed him that hee might bee with him.
\v 19 Howbeit Iesus suffered him not, but saith vnto him, Goe home to thy friends, and tel them how great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath had compassion on thee.
\v 20 And hee departed, and began to publish in Decapolis, how great things Iesus had done for him: and all \add men\add* did marueile.
\v 21 And when Iesus was passed ouer againe by ship vnto the other side, much people gathered vnto him, and he was nigh vnto the Sea.
\v 22 \x + \xo 5:22 \xt Mat. 9.18.\x*And behold, there commeth one of the Rulers of the Synagogue, Iairus by name, and when he saw him, he fell at his feete,
\v 23 And besought him greatly, saying, My litle daughter lieth at the point of death, \add I pray thee\add* come and lay thy hands on her, that shee may be healed, and she shall liue.
\v 24 And Iesus went with him, and much people followed him, and thronged him.
\v 25 And a certaine woman which had an issue of blood twelue yeeres,
\v 26 And had suffered many things of many Physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse,
\v 27 When shee had heard of Iesus, came in the prease behinde, and touched his garment.
\v 28 For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shalbe whole.
\v 29 And straightway the fountaine of her blood was dried vp: and she felt in \add her\add* body that she was healed of that plague.
\v 30 And Iesus immediatly knowing in himselfe that vertue had gone out of him, turned him about in the preasse, and said, Who touched my clothes?
\v 31 And his disciples said vnto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?

\v 4 And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of diuorcement, and to put \add her\add* away.

\v 7 For this cause shall a man leaue his father and mother, and cleaue to his wife,

\v 24 And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Iesus answereth againe, and saith vnto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches, to enter into the kingdom of God?

\v 16 And let him that is in the field, not turne backe againe for to take vp his garment.

\v 18 And pray ye that your flight bee not in the winter.

\v 27 And then shal he send his Angels, and shall gather together his elect from the foure winds, from the vttermost part of the earth, to the vttermost part of heauen.
\v 28 Now learne a parable of the fig tree. When her branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaues, ye know that summer is neere:
\v 29 So ye in like maner, when ye shal see these things come to passe, knowe that it is nigh, \add euen\add* at the doores.
\v 30 Uerely I say vnto you, that this generation shall not passe, till all these things be done.

\v 33 \x + \xo 13:33 \xt Mat.24.42\x*Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is.
\v 34 For the Sonne of man is as a man taking a farre iourney, who left his house, and gaue authority to his seruants, and to euery man his worke, and commanded the porter to watch:
\v 35 Watch ye therefore (for ye knowe not when the master of the house commeth, at Euen, or at midnight, or at the cocke crowing, or in the morning.)
\v 36 Lest comming suddenly, he finde you sleeping.
\v 37 And what I say vnto you, I say vnto all, Watch.
