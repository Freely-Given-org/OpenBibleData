\v 0 1 The \nd LORD\nd* appointeth Ioshua to succeede Moses. 3 The borders of the promised land. 5. 9 God promiseth to assist Ioshua. 8 He giueth him instructions. 10 He prepareth the people to passe ouer Iordan. 12 Ioshua putteth the two tribes and halfe in minde of their promise to Moses. 16 They promise him fealty.
\v 1 ¶ Nowe after the death of Moses the seruant of the \nd LORD\nd*, it came to passe, that the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto Ioshua the sonne of Nun, Moses \f + \fr 1:1 \ft Deut. 1. 38.\f*minister, saying,
\v 2 Moses my seruant is dead: now therefore arise, goe ouer this Iordan, thou, and all this people, vnto the land which I doe giue to them, \add euen\add* to the children of Israel.
\v 3 \f + \fr 1:3 \ft Deut.11. 24. chap. 14.9.\f*Euery place that the sole of your foote shall tread vpon, that haue I giuen vnto you, as I said vnto Moses.
\v 4 From the wildernesse and this Lebanon, euen vnto the great Riuer, the riuer Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and vnto the great sea, toward the going downe of the Sunne, shalbe your coast.
\v 5 There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the dayes of thy life: as I was with Moses, \add so\add* I will be with thee: \f + \fr 1:5 \ft Heb. 13. 6.\f*I will not faile thee, nor forsake thee.
\v 6 \f + \fr 1:6 \ft Deut. 31. 23.\f*Bee strong, and of a good courage: for \f + \fr 1:6 \ft Or, thou shalt cause this people inherite the land, &c.\f*vnto this people shalt thou diuide for an inheritance the land which I sware vnto their fathers to giue them.
\v 7 Onely bee thou strong, and very courageous, that thou mayest obserue to doe according to all the Law, which Moses my seruant commaunded thee: \f + \fr 1:7 \ft Deu. 5.32 and 28. 14.\f*turne not from it \add to\add* the right hand, or \add to\add* the left, that thou mayest \f + \fr 1:7 \ft Or, doe wisely.\f*prosper whither soeuer thou goest.
\v 8 This booke of the Law shal not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest obserue to doe according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt \f + \fr 1:8 \ft Or, doe wisely.\f*haue good successe.
\v 9 Haue not I commanded thee? be strong, and of a good courage, bee not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the \nd LORD\nd* thy God \add is\add* with thee, whither soeuer thou goest.
\v 10 ¶ Then Ioshua commanded the Officers of the people, saying,
\v 11 Passe through the hoste, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals: for within three dayes ye shal passe ouer this Iordan, to goe in to possesse the land which the \nd LORD\nd* your God giueth you, to possesse it.
\v 12 ¶ And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to halfe the tribe of Manasseh, spake Ioshua, saying,
\v 13 \f + \fr 1:13 \ft Num.32 20.\f*Remember the word which Moses the seruant of the \nd LORD\nd* commanded you, saying, The \nd LORD\nd* your God hath giuen you rest, and hath giuen you this land:
\v 14 Your wiues, your litle ones, and your cattell shall remaine in the lande which Moses gaue you on this side Iordan; but ye shall passe before your brethren \f + \fr 1:14 \ft Heb. marshalled by fiue.\f*armed, all the mightie men of valour, and helpe them:
\v 15 Untill the \nd LORD\nd* haue giuen your brethren rest, as \add he hath giuen\add* you, and they also haue possessed the lande which the \nd LORD\nd* your God giueth them: then yee shall returne vnto the land of your possession, and enioy it, which Moses the \nd LORD\nd*s seruant gaue you on this side Iordan toward the Sunne rising.
\v 16 ¶ And they answered Ioshua, saying, All that thou commandest vs, we will doe, and whither soeuer thou sendest vs, we will goe.
\v 17 According as we hearkened vnto Moses in all things, so will we hearken vnto thee: onely the \nd LORD\nd* thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.
\v 18 Whosoeuer \add he be\add* that doth rebell against thy commandement, and will not hearken vnto thy words, in all that thou commandest him, he shall bee put to death: onely be strong, and of a good courage.

\v 0 1 Rahab receiueth and concealeth the two spies sent from Shittim. 8 The couenant betweene her and them. 23 Their returne and relation.
\v 1 ¶ And Ioshua the sonne of Nun sent out of Shittim two men, to spie secretly, saying, Go, view the land, euen Iericho: and they went, and \f + \fr 2:1 \ft Heb.11. 31 iam.2. 25.\f*came into an harlots house, named Rahab, and \f + \fr 2:1 \ft Heb. lay.\f*lodged there.
\v 2 And it was told the king of Iericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to night, of the children of Israel, to search out the countrey.
\v 3 And the king of Iericho sent vnto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entred into thine house: for they bee come to search out all the countrey.
\v 4 And the woman tooke the two men, and hid them, & said thus: There came men vnto mee, but I wist not whence they \em were\em*:
\v 5 And it came to passe \em about the time\em* of shutting of the gate, when it was darke, that the men went out: whither the men went, I wote not: pursue after them quickely, for ye shall ouertake them.
\v 6 But shee had brought them vp to the roofe of the house, and hid them with the stalkes of flaxe, which she had laid in order vpon the roofe.
\v 7 And the men pursued after them the way to Iordan, vnto the foords: and assoone as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.
\v 8 ¶ And before they were laide downe, shee came vp vnto them vpon the roofe.
\v 9 And she said vnto the men, I know that the \nd LORD\nd* hath giuen you the land, and that your terrour is fallen vpon vs, and that all the inhabitants of the land \f + \fr 2:9 \ft Heb. melt.\f*faint because of you:
\v 10 For wee haue heard how the \nd LORD\nd* \f + \fr 2:10 \ft Exod.14 21. chap. 4. 23.\f*dried vp the water of the red Sea for you; when you came out of Egypt, and what you did vnto the two kings of the Amorites that \em were\em* on the other side Iordan, \f + \fr 2:10 \ft Num.21 24.\f*Sihon and Og; whom ye vtterly destroyed.
\v 11 And assoone as we had heard \em these things\em*, our hearts did melt, neither did there \f + \fr 2:11 \ft Heb. rose vp.\f*remaine any more courage in any man, because of you: for the \nd LORD\nd* your God, he \em is\em* God in heauen aboue, and in earth beneath.
\v 12 Now therfore, I pray you, sweare vnto me by the \nd LORD\nd*, since I haue shewed you kindnesse, that ye will also shew kindnesse vnto my fathers house, and giue me a true token:
\v 13 And \em that\em* ye will saue aliue my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they haue, and deliuer our liues from death.
\v 14 And the men answered her, Our life \f + \fr 2:14 \ft Hebr. in stead of you to die.\f*for yours, if yee vtter not this our businesse. And it shall bee when the \nd LORD\nd* hath giuen vs the land, that wee will deale kindely and truely with thee.
\v 15 Then shee let them downe by a coard thorow the window: for her house \em was\em* vpon the towne wall, and she dwelt vpon the wall.
\v 16 And she said vnto them, Get you to the mountaine, lest the pursuers meete you; and hide your selues there three dayes, vntill the pursuers bee returned, and afterward may ye goe your way.
\v 17 And the men said vnto her, Wee will bee blamelesse of this thine oath which thou hast made vs sweare:
\v 18 Behold, \em when\em* we come into the land, thou shalt binde this line of scarlet threed in the window which thou didst let vs downe by: and thou shalt \f + \fr 2:18 \ft Hebr. gather.\f*bring thy father and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy fathers houshold home vnto thee.
\v 19 And it shall bee, \em that\em* whosoeuer shall goe out of the doores of thy house into the street, his blood \em shalbe\em* vpon his head, and wee will bee guiltlesse: and whosoeuer shall bee with thee in the house, his blood \em shalbe\em* on our head, if \em any\em* hand be vpon him.
\v 20 And if thou vtter this our businesse, then we wilbe quit of thine oath which thou hast made vs to sweare.
\v 21 And shee saide, According vnto your words, so \em be\em* it. And she sent them away, & they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.
\v 22 And they went, and came vnto the mountaine, and abode there three dayes, vntill the pursuers were returned. And the pursuers sought \em them\em* thorowout all the way, but found \em them\em* not.
\v 23 ¶ So the two men returned, and descended from the mountaine, and passed ouer, and came to Ioshua the sonne of Nun, and told him all \em things\em* that befell them.
\v 24 And they saide vnto Ioshua, Truely the \nd LORD\nd* hath deliuered into our hands all the land; for euen all the inhabitants of the countrey doe \f + \fr 2:24 \ft Hebr. melt.\f*faint because of vs.

\v 0 1 Ioshua commeth to Iordan. 2 The Officers instruct the people for the passage. 7 The\nd LORD\nd* incourageth Ioshua. 9 Ioshua incourageth the people. 14 The waters of Iordan are diuided.
\v 1 ¶ And Ioshua rose early in the morning, and they remooued from Shittim, and came to Iordan, hee and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed ouer.
\v 2 And it came to passe after three dayes, that the Officers went thorow the hoste;
\v 3 And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the Arke of the Couenant of the \nd LORD\nd* your God, and the Priests the Leuites bearing it, then yee shall remooue from your place, and goe after it.
\v 4 \f + \fr 3:4 \ft Hebr. since yesterday & the third day.\f*Yet there shalbe a space betweene you and it, about two thousand cubites by measure: come not neere vnto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must goe: for yee haue not passed \add this\add* way heretofore.
\v 5 \f + \fr 3:5 \ft Leuit. 20.7. num.11. 18. chap. 7. 13. 1.sam. 16.5.\f*And Ioshua said vnto the people, Sanctifie your selues: for to morrow the \nd LORD\nd* wil do wōders among you.
\v 6 And Ioshua spake vnto the Priests, saying, Take vp the Arke of the Couenant, and passe ouer before the people. And they tooke vp the Arke of the Couenant, and went before the people.
\v 7 ¶ \f + \fr 3:7 \ft Chap.1. 5.\f*And the \nd LORD\nd* saide vnto Ioshua, This day wil I begin to magnifie thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that as I was with Moses, \add so\add* I will be with thee.
\v 8 And thou shalt commaund the Priests that beare the Arke of the Couenant, saying; When ye are come to the brinke of the water of Iordan, yee shall stand still in Iordan.
\v 9 ¶ And Ioshua said vnto the children of Israel, Come hither, and heare the words of the \nd LORD\nd* your God.
\v 10 And Ioshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the liuing God \add is\add* among you, and \add that\add* he will without faile driue out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hiuites, and the Perizzites, and Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Iebusites.
\v 11 Behold, the Arke of the Couenant, euen the \nd LORD\nd* of all the earth, passeth ouer before you, into Iordan.
\v 12 Now therefore take yee twelue men out of the Tribes of Israel, out of euery Tribe a man.
\v 13 \f + \fr 3:13 \ft Psal. 114. 3.\f*And it shall come to passe, assoone as the soles of the feete of the Priestes that beare the Arke of the \nd LORD\nd*, the \nd LORD\nd* of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Iordan, \add that\add* the waters of Iordan shall be cut off, \add from\add* the waters that come downe from aboue: and they shall stand vpon an heape.
\v 14 ¶ \f + \fr 3:14 \ft Acts 7.45.\f*And it came to passe when the people remooued from their tents, to passe ouer Iordan, and the Priests bearing the Arke of the Couenant before the people;
\v 15 \f + \fr 3:15 \ft 1. Chron. 12.15. ecclus. 24.30.\f*And as they that bare the Arke were come vnto Iordan, and the feet of the Priestes that bare the Arke, were dipped in the brimme of the water, (for Iordan ouerfloweth all his banks at the time of haruest)
\v 16 That the waters which came downe from aboue, stood \add and\add* rose vp vpon an heape very farre, from the city Adam, that \add is\add* beside Zaretan: and those that came downe toward the sea of the plaine, \add euen\add* the salt sea, failed, \add and\add* were cut off: and the people passed ouer right against Iericho.
\v 17 And the Priestes that bare the Arke of the Couenant of the \nd LORD\nd*, stood firme on drie ground, in the midst of Iordan, and all the Israelites passed ouer on drie ground, vntill all the people were passed cleane ouer Iordan.

\v 0 1 Twelue men are appointed to take twelue stones for a memoriall out of Iordan. 9 Twelue other stones are set vp in the middest of Iordan. 10. 19 The people passe ouer. 14 God magnifieth Ioshua. 20 The twelue stones are pitched in Gilgal.
\v 1 ¶ \f + \fr 4:1 \ft Deut. 27. 2.\f*\f + \fr 4:1 \ft Chap.3. 12.\f*And it came to passe when all the people were cleane passed ouer Iordan, that the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto Ioshua, saying,
\v 2 Take you twelue men out of the people, out of euery tribe a man,
\v 3 And command you them, saying, Take you hence out of the mids of Iordan, out of the place where the Priests feet stood firme, twelue stones, and yee shal cary them ouer with you, and leaue them in the lodging place where you shall lodge this night.
\v 4 Then Ioshua called the twelue men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of euery tribe a man:
\v 5 And Ioshua said vnto them, Passe ouer before the Arke of the \nd LORD\nd* your God into the mids of Iordan, and take ye vp euery man of you a stone vpon his shoulder, according vnto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel:
\v 6 \f + \fr 4:6 \ft Heb. to morrow.\f*That this may be a signe among you, \add that\add* when your children aske \add their fathers\add* in time to come, saying, What meane you by these stones?
\v 7 Then yee shall answere them, That the waters of Iordan were cut off before the Arke of the Couenant of the \nd LORD\nd*, when it passed ouer Iordan, the waters of Iordan were cut off: and these stones shall bee for a memoriall vnto the children of Israel for euer.
\v 8 And the children of Israel did so as Ioshua commanded, and tooke vp twelue stones out of the midst of Iordan, as the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto Ioshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and caried them ouer with them, vnto the place where they lodged, and laid them downe there.
\v 9 And Ioshua set vp twelue stones in the midst of Iordan, in the place where the feet of the Priests which bare the Arke of the Couenant, stood: and they are there vnto this day.
\v 10 ¶ For the Priests which bare the Arke, stood in the midst of Iordan, vntill euery thing was finished that the \nd LORD\nd* commanded Ioshua to speake vnto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Ioshua: and the people hasted and passed ouer.
\v 11 And it came to passe when all the people were cleane passed ouer, that the Arke of the \nd LORD\nd* passed ouer, and the Priests in the presence of the people.
\v 12 \f + \fr 4:12 \ft Num. 32. 27.\f*And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and halfe the tribe of Manasseh, passed ouer armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spake vnto them:
\v 13 \f + \fr 4:13 \ft Or. ready armed.\f*About fourty thousand prepared for war, passed ouer before the \nd LORD\nd* vnto battell, to the plaines of Iericho.
\v 14 ¶ On that day the \nd LORD\nd* magnified Ioshua in the sight of all Israel, and they feared him, as they feared Moses all the dayes of his life.
\v 15 And the \nd LORD\nd* spake vnto Ioshua, saying,
\v 16 Command the Priests that beare the Arke of the Testimony, that they come vp out of Iordan.
\v 17 Ioshua therefore commaunded the Priests, saying, Come yee vp out of Iordan.
\v 18 \f + \fr 4:18 \ft Hebr. plucked vp.\f*\f + \fr 4:18 \ft Hebr. went.\f*And it came to passe when the Priests that bare the Arke of the Couenant of the \nd LORD\nd*, were come vp out of the mids of Iordan, \add and\add* the soles of the Priests feete were lift vp vnto the dry land, that the waters of Iordan returned vnto their place, and flowed ouer all his banks, as \add they did\add* before.
\v 19 ¶ And the people came vp out of Iordan on the tenth \add day\add* of the first moneth, and encamped in Gilgal, in the East border of Iericho.
\v 20 And those twelue stones which they tooke out of Iordan, did Ioshua pitch in Gilgal.
\v 21 \f + \fr 4:21 \ft Hebr. to morrow.\f*And he spake vnto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shal aske their fathers in time to come, saying, What meane these stones?
\v 22 Then yee shall let your children know, saying, Israel came ouer this Iordan on dry land.
\v 23 \f + \fr 4:23 \ft Exod. 14. 21.\f*For the \nd LORD\nd* your God dried vp the waters of Iordan from before you, vntill yee were passed ouer, as the \nd LORD\nd* your God did to the Red sea, which hee dried vp from before vs, vntill we were gone ouer:
\v 24 \f + \fr 4:24 \ft Hebr. all dayes.\f*That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the \nd LORD\nd*, that it \add is\add* mighty, that ye might feare the \nd LORD\nd* your God for euer.

\v 0 1 The Canaanites are afraid. 2 Ioshua renueth Circumcision. 10 The Passeouer is kept at Gilgal. 12 Manna ceaseth. 13 An Angel appeareth to Ioshua.
\v 1 ¶ And it came to passe when all the Kings of the Amorites which \add were\add* on the side of Iordan Westward, and all the Kings of the Canaanites, which \add were\add* by the Sea, heard that the \nd LORD\nd* had dried vp the waters of Iordan from before the children of Israel, vntill we were passed ouer, that their heart melted; neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.
\v 2 ¶ \f + \fr 5:2 \ft Exod.4. 25.\f*\f + \fr 5:2 \ft Or, kniues of flints.\f*At that time the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Ioshua, Make thee sharpe kniues, and circumcise againe the children of Israel the second time.
\v 3 \f + \fr 5:3 \ft Or, Gibeah-haaraloth.\f*And Ioshua made him sharpe kniues, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskinnes.
\v 4 And this \add is\add* the cause why Ioshua did circumcise: all the people that came out of Egypt, \add that were\add* males, \add euen\add* all the men of warre, died in the wildernes by the way after they came out of Egypt.
\v 5 Now all the people that came out, were circumcised, but all the people \add that were\add* borne in the wildernesse by the way, as they came foorth out of Egypt, \add them\add* they had not circumcised.
\v 6 \f + \fr 5:6 \ft Num.14 23.\f*For the children of Israel walked fourtie yeeres in the wildernesse, till all the people \add that were\add* men of warre which came out of Egypt were consumed, because they obeyed not the voyce of the \nd LORD\nd*, vnto whome the \nd LORD\nd* sware that hee would not shew them the land which the \nd LORD\nd* sware vnto their fathers, that he would giue vs, a land that floweth with milke & honie.
\v 7 And their children, \add whom\add* hee raised vp in their stead, them Ioshua circumcised, for they were vncircumcised: because they had not circumcised them by the way.
\v 8 \f + \fr 5:8 \ft Heb. when the people had made an end to be circumcised.\f*And it came to passe when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the campe, till they were whole.
\v 9 \f + \fr 5:9 \ft i. rolling.\f*And the \nd LORD\nd* saide vnto Ioshua, This day haue I rolled away the reproch of Egypt from off you: Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal vnto this day.
\v 10 ¶ And the children of Israel incamped in Gilgal, and kept the Passeouer, on the fourteenth day of the moneth at euen, in the plaines of Iericho.
\v 11 And they did eate of the olde corne of the land, on the morrow after the Passeouer, vnleauened cakes, and parched corne in the selfe same day.
\v 12 ¶ And the Manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corne of the land, neither had the children of Israel Manna any more, but they did eate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that yeere.
\v 13 ¶ \f + \fr 5:13 \ft Exod. 23. 23.\f*And it came to passe when Ioshua was by Iericho, that he lift vp his eyes, and looked, and beholde, there stood a man ouer against him, with his sword dawen in his hand: and Ioshua went vnto him, and said vnto him, \add Art\add* thou for vs, or for our aduersaries?
\v 14 \f + \fr 5:14 \ft Or, Prince.\f*And he said, Nay, but \add as\add* captaine of the hoste of the \nd LORD\nd* am I now come. And Ioshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said vnto him, What saith my \nd LORD\nd* vnto his seruant?
\v 15 \f + \fr 5:15 \ft Exod.3.9. acts.7.33.\f*And the captaine of the \nd LORD\nd*s hoste said vnto Ioshua, Loose thy shooe from off thy foote, for the place whereon thou standest, \add is\add* holy: And Ioshua did so.

\v 0 1 Iericho is shut vp. 2 God instructeth Ioshua how to besiege it. 12 The citie is compassed. 17 It must be accursed. 20 The walles fall downe. 22 Rahab is saued. 26 The builder of Iericho is cursed.
\v 1 ¶ \f + \fr 6:1 \ft Hebr. did shut vp, and was shut vp.\f*Now Iericho was straitly shut vp, because of the children of Israel: none went out, & none came in.
\v 2 And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Ioshua, See, I haue giuen into thine hand Iericho, and the King thereof, \add and\add* the mighty men of valour.
\v 3 And ye shall compasse the city, all yee men of warre, \add and\add* goe round about the city once: thus shalt thou doe sixe dayes.
\v 4 And seuen Priests shall beare before the Arke seuen trumpets of rams hornes: and the seuenth day yee shall compasse the city seuen times, and the Priests shall blow with the trumpets.
\v 5 \f + \fr 6:5 \ft Hebr. vnder it.\f*And it shall come to passe that when they make a long \add blast\add* with the rammes-horne, \add and\add* when ye heare the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout: and the wall of the citie shall fall downe flat, and the people shall ascend vp euery man straight before him.
\v 6 ¶ And Ioshua the sonne of Nun called the Priests, and said vnto them, Take vp the Arke of the Couenant, and let seuen Priests beare seuen trumpets of rammes-hornes, before the Arke of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 7 And he said vnto the people, Passe on, and compasse the city, and let him that is armed passe on before the Arke of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 8 ¶ And it came to passe when Ioshua had spoken vnto the people, that the seuen Priestes bearing the seuen trumpets of rammes hornes, passed on before the \nd LORD\nd*, and blew with the trumpets: and the Arke of the Couenant of the \nd LORD\nd* followed them.
\v 9 ¶ \f + \fr 6:9 \ft Heb. gathering host\f*And the armed men went before the Priests that blew with the trumpets: and the rereward came after the Arke, the Priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.
\v 10 \f + \fr 6:10 \ft Heb. make your voyce to be heard.\f*And Ioshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall \add any\add* word proceed out of your mouth, vntill the day I bid you shoute, then shall ye shoute.
\v 11 So the Arke of the \nd LORD\nd* compassed the citie, going about \add it\add* once: and they came into the campe, and lodged in the campe.
\v 12 ¶ And Ioshua rose earely in the morning, and the Priests tooke vp the Arke of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 13 And seuen Priests bearing seuen trumpets of rammes hornes before the Arke of the \nd LORD\nd*, went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them, but the rereward came after the Arke of the \nd LORD\nd*, the Priests going on and blowing with the trumpets.
\v 14 And the second day they compassed the citie once, and returned into the campe: so they did sixe dayes.
\v 15 And it came to passe on the seuenth day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the citie after the same maner, seuen times: only on that day they compassed the citie seuen times.
\v 16 And it came to passe at the seuenth time, when the Priests blewe with the trumpets, Ioshua said vnto the people, Shout, for the \nd LORD\nd* hath giuen you the citie.
\v 17 ¶ \f + \fr 6:17 \ft Or, deuoted.\f*\f + \fr 6:17 \ft Chap.2.4\f*And the citie shalbe accursed, \add euen\add* it, and all that \add are\add* therein, to the \nd LORD\nd*: onely Rahab the harlot shal liue, she, and all that \add are\add* with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.

\v 2 And Ioshua sent men from Iericho to Ai, which \add is\add* beside Beth-auen, on the East side of Bethel, and spake vnto them, saying, Goe vp and view the countrey. And the men went vp, and viewed Ai.
\v 3 \f + \fr 7:3 \ft Heb. about 2000.men: or, about 3000.men.\f*And they returned to Ioshua, and said vnto him, Let not all the people goe vp: but let about two or three thousand men goe vp, and smite Ai, \add and\add* make not all the people to labour thither, for they \add are but\add* few.

\v 7 And Ioshua said, Alas, O \nd LORD\nd* God, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people ouer Iordan, to deliuer vs into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy vs? Would to God we had bene content, and dwelt on the other side Iordan.

\v 16 ¶ So Ioshua rose vp earely in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes, and the tribe of Iudah was taken.
\v 17 And hee brought the familie of Iudah, and he tooke the familie of the Zarhites: and he brought the familie of the Zarhites, man by man, and Zabdi was taken.
\v 18 And hee brought his houshold, man by man, and Achan the sonne of Carmi, the sonne of Zabdi, the sonne of Zerah, of the tribe of Iudah, was taken.
\v 19 And Ioshua said vnto Achan, My sonne, giue, I pray thee, glory to the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel, and make confession vnto him, and tel me now, what thou hast done, hide \add it\add* not from me.

\v 25 And Ioshua said, Why hast thou troubled vs? the \nd LORD\nd* shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.

\v 3 ¶ So Ioshua arose, and all the people of warre, to goe vp against Ai: and Ioshua chose out thirtie thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night:
\v 4 And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the citie, \add euen\add* behind the citie: goe not very farre from the citie, but be ye all ready:

\v 9 ¶ Ioshua therefore sent them foorth, and they went to lie in ambush, and abode betweene Bethel and Ai, on the West side of Ai: but Ioshua lodged that night among the people.
\v 10 And Ioshua rose vp early in the morning, and numbred the people, and went vp; he, and the Elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.
\v 11 And all the people, \add euen the people\add* of warre that \add were\add* with him, went vp, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the North side of Ai: now \add there was\add* a valley betweene them and Ai.

\v 14 ¶ And it came to passe when the King of Ai saw \add it\add*, that they hasted, and rose vp early, and the men of the citie went out against Israel to battell, hee, and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plaine, but hee wist not that \add there were\add* liers in ambush against him behind the city.
\v 15 And Ioshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wildernesse.
\v 16 And all the people that \add were\add* in Ai, were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Ioshua, and were drawen away from the city.
\v 17 And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not out after Israel: and they left the citie open, and pursued after Israel.
\v 18 And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Ioshua, Stretch out the speare that \add is\add* in thy hand, toward Ai; for I will giue it into thine hand. And Ioshua stretched out the speare that hee had in his hand, toward the city.
\v 19 And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ranne as soone as he had stretched out his hand: and they entred into the city, and tooke it, and hasted, and set the citie on fire.

\v 21 And when Ioshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned againe and slew the men of Ai.

\v 23 And the King of Ai they tooke aliue, and brought him to Ioshua.
\v 24 And it came to passe when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai, in the field, in the wildernesse wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, vntill they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned vnto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.
\v 25 And \add so\add* it was \add that\add* all that fell that day, both of men and women, \add were\add* twelue thousand, \add euen\add* all the men of Ai.

\v 18 And the children of Israel smote them not, because the Princes of the Congregation had sworne vnto them by the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel: And all the Congregation murmured against the Princes.

\v 0 1 Fiue Kings warre against Gibeon. 6 Ioshua rescueth it. 10 God fighteth against them with hailestones. 12 The Sunne and Moone stand still at the word of Ioshua. 16 The fiue Kings are mured in a caue. 21 They are brought forth, 24 scornefully vsed, 26 and hanged. 28 Seuen Kings more are conquered. 43 Ioshua returneth to Gilgal.
\v 1 ¶ \f + \fr 10:1 \ft Chap.6. 15.\f*\f + \fr 10:1 \ft Chap. 8.3.\f*Now it came to passe when Adoni-zedek King of Ierusalem, had heard how Ioshua had taken Ai, and had vtterly destroyed it, ( as he had done to Iericho, and her King, so hee had done to Ai, and her King) and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them,

\v 3 Wherefore Adoni-zedek King of Ierusalem, sent vnto Hoham King of Hebron, and vnto Piram, king of Iarmuth, and vnto Iaphia king of Lachish, and vnto Debir king of Eglon, saying,
\v 4 Come vp vnto me, and helpe me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Ioshua, and with the children of Israel.
\v 5 Therefore the fiue Kings of the Amorites, the king of Ierusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Iarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselues together, and went vp, they, and all their hostes, and encamped before Gibeon, and made warre against it.
\v 6 ¶ And the men of Gibeon sent vnto Ioshua to the campe to Gilgal, saying, Slacke not thy hand from thy seruants, come vp to vs quickly, and saue vs, and helpe vs: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountaines, are gathered together against vs.
\v 7 So Ioshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of warre with him, and all the mighty men of valour.
\v 8 ¶ And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Ioshua, Feare them not: for I haue deliuered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.
\v 9 Ioshua therefore came vnto them suddenly, and went vp from Gilgal all night.
\v 10 And the \nd LORD\nd* discomfited them before Israel, and slewe them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth vp to Bethoron, and smote them to Azekah and vnto Makkedah.
\v 11 And it came to passe as they fled from before Israel, \add and\add* were in the going downe to Bethoron, that the \nd LORD\nd* cast downe great stones from heauen vpon them, vnto Azekah, and they died: \add they were\add* moe which died with hailestones, then \add they\add* whome the children of Israel slew with the sword.

\v 14 And there was no day like that, before it, or after it, that the \nd LORD\nd* hearkened vnto the voyce of a man: for the \nd LORD\nd* fought for Israel.
\v 15 ¶ And Ioshua returned, and all Israel with him, vnto the campe to Gilgal.
\v 16 But these fiue kings fled, and hid themselues in a caue at Makkedah.
\v 17 And it was told Ioshua, saying, The fiue kings are found hid in a caue at Makkedah.
\v 18 And Ioshua said, Roule great stones vpon the mouth of the caue, and set men by it, for to keepe them.
\v 19 \f + \fr 10:19 \ft Heb. cut off the taile.\f*And stay you not, \add but\add* pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them, suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the \nd LORD\nd* your God hath deliuered them into your hand.

\v 21 And all the people returned to the campe to Ioshua at Makkedah in peace: none mooued his tongue against any of the children of Israel.
\v 22 Then said Ioshua, Open the mouth of the caue, and bring out those fiue kings vnto me out of the caue.
\v 23 And they did so, and brought forth those fiue kings vnto him out of the caue, the king of Ierusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Iarmuth, the king of Lachish, \add and\add* the king of Eglon.
\v 24 And it came to passe when they brought out those kings vnto Ioshua, that Ioshua called for all the men of Israel, and saide vnto the captaines of the men of war which went with him, Come neere, put your feete vpon the neckes of these kings. And they came neere, and put their feet vpon the necks of them.
