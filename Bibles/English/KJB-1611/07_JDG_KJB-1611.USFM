\v 1 ¶ Now after the death of Ioshua, it came to passe, that the children of Israel asked the \nd LORD\nd*, saying, Who shal goe vp for vs against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?
\v 2 And the \nd LORD\nd* sayd, Iudah shall goe vp: Behold, I haue deliuered the land into his hand.
\v 3 And Iudah saide vnto Simeon his brother, Come vp with me into my lot, that wee may fight against the Canaanites, and I likewise will goe with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.
\v 4 And Iudah went vp, and the \nd LORD\nd* deliuered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.
\v 5 And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites, and the Perizzites.
\v 6 But Adoni-bezek fled, and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbes, and his great toes.
\v 7 And Adoni-bezek said, Threescore & ten kings, hauing \f + \fr 1:7 \ft Hebr. the thumbes of their hands and of their feete.\f*their thumbs and their great toes cut off, \f + \fr 1:7 \ft Or, gleaned\f*gathered their meate vnder my table: as I haue done, so God hath requited mee, and they brought him to Ierusalem, and there he died.
\v 8 (Now the children of Iudah had fought against Ierusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the citie on fire)
\v 9 ¶ \f + \fr 1:9 \ft Iosh.10. 36. and 11. 21. and 15. 13.\f*And afterward the children of Iudah went downe to fight against the Canaanites that dwelt in the moūtaine, & in the South, and in the \f + \fr 1:9 \ft Or, lowe countrey.\f*valley.

\v 11 And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir, (& the name of Debir before \add was\add* Kiriath-sepher)
\v 12 And Caleb said, Hee that smiteth Kiriath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I giue Achsah my daughter to wife.
\v 13 And Othniel the sonne of Kenaz Calebs yonger brother tooke it: and he gaue him Achsah his daughter to wife.
\v 14 And it came to passe when shee came \add to him\add*, that she moued him to aske of \add her\add* father a field: and shee lighted from off her asse, and Caleb said vnto her, What wilt thou?
\v 15 And she said vnto him, Giue me a blessing: for thou hast giuen mee a South land, giue me also springs of water. And Caleb gaue her the vpper springs, and the nether springs.
\v 16 ¶ And the children of the Kenite, Moses father in law, went vp out of the citie of palme trees, with the children of Iudah into the wildernesse of Iudah, which \add lieth\add* in the South of Arad, and they went and dwelt among the people.
\v 17 And Iudah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and vtterly destroyed it, (and the name of the \f + \fr 1:17 \ft Num. 21. 3.\f*citie was called Hormah.)
\v 18 Also Iudah tooke Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.
\v 19 And the \nd LORD\nd* was with Iudah, and hee \f + \fr 1:19 \ft Or, he possesed the mountaine.\f*draue out \add the inhabitants of\add* the mountaine, but could not driue out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had charets of yron.
\v 20 And they gaue Hebron vnto Caleb, \f + \fr 1:20 \ft Num.14. 24. iosh.14 13. & 15. 14.\f*as Moses saide: and hee expelled thence the three sonnes of Anak.
\v 21 And the children of Beniamin did not driue out the Iebusites that inhabited Ierusalem: but the Iebusites dwel with the children of Beniamin in Ierusalem, vnto this day.
\v 22 ¶ And the house of Ioseph, they also went vp against Bethel: and the \nd LORD\nd* \add was\add* with them.
\v 23 And the house of Ioseph sent to descrie Bethel (now the name of the citie before \add was\add* \f + \fr 1:23 \ft Gen.28. 19.\f*Luz)
\v 24 And the spies sawe a man come forth out of the citie, and they said vnto him, Shew vs, wee pray thee, the entrance into the citie, and \f + \fr 1:24 \ft Iosh.2.14\f*we will shew thee mercie.
\v 25 And when hee shewed them the entrance into the citie, they smote the citie with the edge of the sword: but they let goe the man and all his familie.
\v 26 And the man went into the lande of the Hittites, and built a citie, and called the name thereof Luz: which \add is\add* the name thereof vnto this day.
\v 27 ¶ \f + \fr 1:27 \ft Iosh.17. 11,12.\f*Neither did Manasseh driue out \add the inhabitants of\add* Bethshean, and her townes, nor Taanach and her townes, nor the inhabitants of Dor, and her townes, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam, and her townes, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo, and her townes: but the Canaanites would dwel in that land.
\v 28 And it came to passe when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, and did not vtterly driue them out.
\v 29 ¶ \f + \fr 1:29 \ft Iosh.16. 10.\f*Neither did Ephraim driue out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.
\v 30 ¶ Neither did Zebulun driue out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol: but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became tributaries.
\v 31 ¶ Neither did Asher driue out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor Achzib, nor Helbath, nor Aphik, nor of Rehob:
\v 32 But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not driue them out.
\v 33 ¶ Neither did Naphtali driue out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, nor the inhabitants of Bethanath, but hee dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: neuerthelesse, the inhabitants of Bethshemesh, and of Bethanath, became tributaries vnto them.
\v 34 And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountaine: for they would not suffer them to come downe to the valley.
\v 35 \f + \fr 1:35 \ft Hebr. was heauy.\f*But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aiialon, & in Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Ioseph preuailed, so that they became tributaries.

\iex 1 An Angel rebuketh the people at Bochim. 6 The wickednesse of the new generation after Ioshua. 14 Gods anger and pitie towards them. 20 The Canaanites are left to prooue Israel.
\v 1 ¶ \f + \fr 2:1 \ft Or, messenger.\f*And an Angel of the \nd LORD\nd* came vp from Gilgal to Bochim, and said, I made you to goe vp out of Egypt, and haue brought you vnto the land which I sware vnto your fathers, and I said, I will neuer breake my Couenant with you.
\v 2 \f + \fr 2:2 \ft Deut.7.2.\f*\f + \fr 2:2 \ft Deut. 12. 3.\f*And yee shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land, you shal throw downe their altars: But ye haue not obeyed my voyce; Why haue ye done this?
\v 3 \f + \fr 2:3 \ft Iosh.23. 13.\f*\f + \fr 2:3 \ft Exod. 23. 33. and 34. 12.\f*Wherefore I also said, I will not driue them out from before you: but they shalbe as thornes in your sides, and their gods shalbe a snare vnto you.
\v 4 And it came to passe when the Angel of the \nd LORD\nd* spake these words vnto all the children of Israel, that the people lift vp their voice, and wept.
\v 5 \f + \fr 2:5 \ft That is, weepers.\f*And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed there vnto the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 6 ¶ And when Ioshua had let the people goe, the children of Israel went euery man vnto his inheritance, to possesse the land.
\v 7 \f + \fr 2:7 \ft Hebr. prolonged dayes after Ioshua.\f*And the people serued the \nd LORD\nd* all the dayes of Ioshua, and all the dayes of the Elders that outliued Ioshua, who had seene all the great workes of the \nd LORD\nd*, that hee did for Israel.
\v 8 And Ioshua the sonne of Nun, the seruant of the \nd LORD\nd* died, \add being\add* an hundred and ten yeeres old.
\v 9 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-Heres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the North side of the hill Gaash.
\v 10 And also all that generation were gathered vnto their fathers: and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the \nd LORD\nd*, nor yet the woorkes which hee had done for Israel.
\v 11 ¶ And the children of Israel did euil in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, and serued Baalim:
\v 12 And they forsooke the \nd LORD\nd* God of their fathers, which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the people that \add were\add* round about them, and bowed themselues vnto them, and prouoked the \nd LORD\nd* to anger.
\v 13 And they forsooke the \nd LORD\nd*, and serued Baal and Ashtaroth.
\v 14 ¶ \f + \fr 2:14 \ft Psal.44. 12. isa.50. 1.\f*And the anger of the \nd LORD\nd* was hote against Israel, and he deliuered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.
\v 15 \f + \fr 2:15 \ft Leuit.26 deut.28.\f*Whither soeuer they went out, the hand of the \nd LORD\nd* was against them for euill, as the \nd LORD\nd* had said, and as the \nd LORD\nd* had sworne vnto them: and they were greatly distressed.
\v 16 ¶ \f + \fr 2:16 \ft Hebr. saued.\f*Neuerthelesse, the \nd LORD\nd* raysed vp Iudges, which deliuered them out of the hand of those that spoyled them.
\v 17 And yet they would not hearken vnto their Iudges, but they went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselues vnto them: they turned quickly out of the way, which their fathers walked in, obeying the Commandements of the \nd LORD\nd*; \add but\add* they did not so.
\v 18 And when the \nd LORD\nd* raised them vp Iudges, then the \nd LORD\nd* was with the Iudge, and deliuered them out of the hand of their enemies, all the dayes of the Iudge (for it repented the \nd LORD\nd*, because of their gronings by reason of them that oppressed them, and vexed them:)

\v 20 ¶ And the anger of the \nd LORD\nd* was hote against Israel, and he said, Because that this people hath transgressed my Couenant which I commanded their fathers, and haue not hearkened vnto my voice:
\v 21 I also will not henceforth driue out any from before them of the nations which Ioshua left when he died:

\iex 1 The nations which were left to prooue Israel. 6 By communion with them they commit idolatrie. 8 Othniel deliuereth them from Chushan-Rishathaim. 12 Ehud from Eglon. 31 Shamgar from the Philistines.
\v 1 ¶ Now these \add are\add* the nations which the \nd LORD\nd* left, to prooue Israel by them, (\add euen\add* as many \add of Israel\add* as had not knowen all the warres of Canaan;
\v 2 Onely that the generations of the children of Israel might know to teach them warre, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof:)
\v 3 \add Namely\add* fiue lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hiuites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-Hermon, vnto the entring in of Hamath.
\v 4 And they were to prooue Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken vnto the Commandements of the \nd LORD\nd*, which hee commaunded their fathers by the hand of Moses.
\v 5 ¶ And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hiuites, and Iebusites,
\v 6 And they tooke their daughters to be their wiues, and gaue their daughters to their sonnes, and serued their gods.
\v 7 And the children of Israel did euill in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, and forgate the \nd LORD\nd* their God, and serued Baalim, and the groues.
\v 8 ¶ \f + \fr 3:8 \ft Hebr. Aram-naharaim.\f*Therefore the anger of the \nd LORD\nd* was hote against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushan-Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel serued Chushan-Rishathaim eight yeeres.
\v 9 \f + \fr 3:9 \ft Hebr. sauiour.\f*And when the children of Israel cryed vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, the \nd LORD\nd* raised vp a deliuerer to the children of Israel, who deliuered them, \add euen\add* Othniel the sonne of Kenaz, Calebs yonger brother.

\v 11 And the land had rest forty yeres: and Othniel the sonne of Kenaz died.
\v 12 ¶ And the children of Israel did euill againe in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*: and the \nd LORD\nd* strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done euill in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 13 And hee gathered vnto him the children of Ammon, and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of Palme-trees.
\v 14 So the children of Israel serued Eglon the King of Moab eighteene yeeres.
\v 15 \f + \fr 3:15 \ft Or, the sonne of Iemini.\f*\f + \fr 3:15 \ft Hebr. shut of his right hand.\f*But when the children of Israel cried vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, the \nd LORD\nd* raised them vp a deliuerer, Ehud the sonne of Gera, a Beniamite, a man left handed: and by him the children of Israel sent a Present vnto Eglon the king of Moab.
\v 16 But Ehud made him a dagger (which had two edges) of a cubite length, and he did gird it vnder his raiment, vpon his right thigh,
\v 17 And he brought the present vnto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon \add was\add* a very fat man.
\v 18 And when he had made an end to offer the Present, he sent away the people that bare the Present.
\v 19 \f + \fr 3:19 \ft Or, grauen images.\f*But hee himselfe turned againe from the quarries that \add were\add* by Gilgal, and said, I haue a secret errand vnto thee, O king: who said, Keepe silence. And all that stood by him, went out from him.
\v 20 \f + \fr 3:20 \ft Heb. a parlour of cooling.\f*And Ehud came vnto him, and he was sitting in a Summer parlour, which hee had for himselfe alone: And Ehud said, I haue a message from God vnto thee. And he arose out of \add his\add* seat.
\v 21 And Ehud put forth his left hand, and tooke the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly.
\v 22 \f + \fr 3:22 \ft Or, it came out at the fundament.\f*And the haft also went in after the blade: and the fatte closed vpon the blade, so that hee could not drawe the dagger out of his belly, and the dirt came out.
\v 23 Then Ehud went forth through the porche, and shut the doores of the parlour vpon him, and locked them.
\v 24 \f + \fr 3:24 \ft Or, doth his easement.\f*When he was gone out, his seruants came, and when they saw, that behold, the doores of the parlour \add were\add* locked, they said, Surely he couereth his feet in his Summer chamber.
\v 25 And they taried till they were ashamed: and behold, he opened not the doores of the parlour, therefore they tooke a key, and opened \add them\add*: and behold, their lord \add was\add* fallen downe dead on the earth.
\v 26 And Ehud escaped while they taried: and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped vnto Seirath.
\v 27 And it came to passe when hee was come, that hee blew a trumpet in the mountaine of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went downe with him from the mount, & he before them.
\v 28 And hee said vnto them, Follow after me: for the \nd LORD\nd* hath deliuered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went downe after him, and tooke the foords of Iordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to passe ouer.
\v 29 \f + \fr 3:29 \ft Heb. fat.\f*And they slewe of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour, and there escaped not a man.
\v 30 So Moab was subdued that day vnder the hand of Israel: and the land had rest fourescore yeeres.
\v 31 ¶ And after him was Shamgar the sonne of Anath, which slew of the Philistines sixe hundred men with an oxe goad, and he also deliuered Israel.

\iex 1 Deborah and Barak deliuer them from Iabin and Sisera. 18 Iael killeth Sisera.

\v 2 And the \nd LORD\nd* sold them into the hande of Iabin king of Canaan: that reigned in Hazor, the captaine of whose host \add was\add* Sisera, which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.
\v 3 And the children of Israel cried vnto the \nd LORD\nd*: for he had nine hundred charets of yron: and twentie yeres hee mightily oppressed the children of Israel.
\v 4 ¶ And Deborah a prophetesse, the wife of Lapidoth, shee iudged Israel at that time.
\v 5 And shee dwelt vnder the palme tree of Deborah, betweene Ramah and Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came vp to her for iudgement.
\v 6 And shee sent and called Barak the sonne of Abinoam, out of Kedesh-Naphtali, and said vnto him, Hath not the \nd LORD\nd* God of Israel commaunded, \add saying\add*, Goe, and drawe toward mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali, and of the children of Zebulun?
\v 7 \f + \fr 4:7 \ft Psal.83. 9, 10.\f*And I wil draw vnto thee to the riuer Kishon, Sisera the captaine of Iabins army, with his charets, and his multitude, and I will deliuer him into thine hand.
\v 8 And Barak said vnto her, If thou wilt goe with me, then I wil goe: but if thou wilt not goe with mee, \add then\add* I will not goe.
\v 9 And she said, I wil surely go with thee, notwithstanding the iourney that thou takest, shal not be for thine honor: for the \nd LORD\nd* shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, & went with Barak to Kedesh.
\v 10 ¶ And Barak called Zebulun, and Naphtali to Kedesh, and he went vp with ten thousand men at his feete: and Deborah went vp with him.

\v 14 And Deborah said vnto Barak, Up, for this \add is\add* the day in which the \nd LORD\nd* hath deliuered Sisera into thine hand: Is not the \nd LORD\nd* gone out before thee? so Barak went downe from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.

\iex 1 Abimelech by conspiracie with the Shechemites, and murder of his brethren, is made King. 7 Iotham by a parable rebuketh them and foretelleth their ruine. 22 Gaal conspireth with the Shechemites against him. 30 Zebul reuealeth it. 34 Abimelech ouercommeth them, and soweth the citie with salt. 46 Hee burneth the holde of the god Berith. 50 At Thebez he is slaine by a piece of a milstone. 56 Iothams curse is fulfilled.
\v 1 ¶ And Abimelech the sonne of Ierubbaal went to Shechem, vnto his mothers brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mothers father, saying;

\v 3 \f + \fr 9:3 \ft Heb. after.\f*And his mothers brethren spake of him in the eares of all the men of Shechem, all these wordes, and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech: for they said, He \add is\add* our brother.
\v 4 And they gaue him threescore and ten \add pieces\add* of siluer, out of the house of Baal-Berith, wherewith Abimelech hired vaine & light persons, which followed him.
\v 5 And hee went vnto his fathers house at Ophrah, and slewe his brethren the sonnes of Ierubbaal, \add being\add* threescore and tenne persons, vpon one stone: notwithstanding, yet Iotham the youngest sonne of Ierubbaal was left; for he hid himselfe.
\v 6 \f + \fr 9:6 \ft Or, by the oke of the pillar. See Iosh.24. 26.\f*And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech King, by the plaine of the pillar that \add was\add* in Shechem.
\v 7 ¶ And when they told \add it\add* to Iotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lift vp his voice, and cried, and said vnto them, Hearken vnto mee, you men of Shechem, that God may hearken vnto you.
\v 8 The trees went foorth \add on a time\add* to annoint a King ouer them, and they said vnto the Oliue tree, Reigne thou ouer vs.

\v 10 And the trees said to the Figge tree, Come thou, \add and\add* reigne ouer vs.
\v 11 But the Figge tree saide vnto them, Should I forsake my sweetenesse, and my good fruit, and goe to be promoted ouer the trees?
\v 12 Then saide the trees vnto the Uine, Come thou, \add and\add* reigne ouer vs.
\v 13 And the Uine said vnto them, Should I leaue my wine, which cheareth God and man, and goe to bee promoted ouer the trees?
\v 14 \f + \fr 9:14 \ft Or, thistle.\f*Then said all the trees vnto the Bramble, Come thou, \add and\add* reigne ouer vs.
\v 15 And the Bramble said vnto the trees, If in trueth ye anoint me King ouer you, \add then\add* come, \add and\add* put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the Bramble, and deuoure the Cedars of Lebanon.
\v 16 Now therefore, if yee haue done truely and sincerely, in that yee haue made Abimelech King, and if yee haue dealt well with Ierubbaal, and his house, and haue done vnto him according to the deseruing of his hands:
\v 17 \f + \fr 9:17 \ft Heb. cast his life.\f*(For my father fought for you, and aduentured his life farre, and deliuered you out of the hand of Midian:
\v 18 And yee are risen vp against my fathers house this day, and haue slaine his sonnes, threescore aud ten persons, vpon one stone, and haue made Abimelech the sonne of his maidseruant, king ouer the men of Shechem, because he \add is\add* your brother.)
\v 19 If yee then haue dealt truely and sincerely with Ierubbaal, and with his house this day, \add then\add* reioyce yee in Abimelech, aud let him also reioyce in you.
\v 20 But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and deuoure the men of Shechem and the house of Millo: and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and deuoure Abimeleeh.
\v 21 And Iotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there for feare of Abimeleeh his brother.
\v 22 ¶ When Abimelech had reigned three yeeres ouer Israel,
\v 23 Then God sent an euill spirit betweene Abimelech & the men of Shechem: and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:
\v 24 \f + \fr 9:24 \ft Hebr. strengthened his hands to kill.\f*That the crueltie \add done\add* to the threescore and ten sonnes of Ierubbaal might come, and their blood be laid vpon Abimelech their brother which slew them, and vpon the men of Shechem which aided him in the killing of his brethren.
\v 25 And the men of Shechem set lyers in wait for him in the toppe of the mountaines, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.
\v 26 And Gaal the sonne of Ebed came with his brethren, and went ouer to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.
\v 27 \f + \fr 9:27 \ft Or, songs.\f*And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and trode \add the grapes\add*, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and did eate and drinke, and cursed Abimelech.
\v 28 And Gaal the sonne of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serue him? Is not he the sonne of Ierubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serue the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serue him?
\v 29 And would to God this people were vnder my hand; then would I remoue Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine armie and come out.
\v 30 ¶ \f + \fr 9:30 \ft Or, hate.\f*And when Zebul the ruler of the citie heard the wordes of Gaal the sonne of Ebed, his anger was kindled.
\v 31 \f + \fr 9:31 \ft Heb. craftily, or to Tormah.\f*And he sent messengers vnto Abimelech priuily, saying, Behold, Gaal the sonne of Ebed, and his brethren, be come to Shechem, and behold, they fortifie the citie against thee.
\v 32 Now therefore vp by night, thou and the people that \add is\add* with thee, and lie in wait in the field.
\v 33 \f + \fr 9:33 \ft Hebr. as thine hand shall find.\f*And it shalbe, \add that\add* in the morning assoone as the Sunne is vp, thou shalt rise earely, and set vpon the citie: and behold, \add when\add* he and the people that \add is\add* with him, come out against thee, then mayest thou doe to them as thou shalt finde occasion.
\v 34 ¶ And Abimelech rose vp, and all the people that \add were\add* with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in foure companies.
\v 35 And Gaal the sonne of Ebed went out, and stood in the entring of the gate of the citie: and Abimelech rose vp, and the people that \add were\add* with him, from lying in waite.
\v 36 And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people downe frō the top of the mountaines. And Zebul saide vnto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountaines, as if they were men.
\v 37 \f + \fr 9:37 \ft Heb. nauell\f*\f + \fr 9:37 \ft Or, the regarders of times.\f*And Gaal spake againe, and said, See, there come people downe by the middle of the land, and another companie come along by the plaine of Meonenim.
\v 38 Then said Zebul vnto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherwith thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that wee should serue him? Is not this the people that thou hast despised? Goe out, I pray now, and fight with them.
\v 39 And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.
\v 40 And Abimelech chased him, and hee fledde before him, and many were ouerthrowen \add and\add* wounded, \add euen\add* vnto the entring of the gate.
\v 41 And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.
\v 42 And it came to passe on the morrow, that the people went out into the field, and they tolde Abimelech.
\v 43 And he tooke the people, and diuided them into three companies, and laide waite in the field, and looked, and behold, the people \add were\add* come forth out of the citie, and he rose vp against them, and smote them.
\v 44 And Abimelech, and the companie that \add was\add* with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entring of the gate of the citie: and the two \add other\add* companies ranne vpon all \add the people\add* that \add were\add* in the fields, and slew them.
\v 45 And Abimelech fought against the citie all that day, and he tooke the citie, and slewe the people that \add was\add* therein, and beat downe the citie, and sowed it with salt.
\v 46 ¶ And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard \add that\add*, they entred into an holde of the house of the god Berith.
\v 47 And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the towre of Shechem were gathered together.
\v 48 \f + \fr 9:48 \ft Heb. I haue done.\f*And Abimelech gate him vp to mount Zalmon, hee and all the people that \add were\add* with him, & Abimelech tooke an axe in his hand, and cut downe a bough from the trees, and tooke \add it\add*, and laide it on his shoulder, and said vnto the people that \add were\add* with him, What ye haue seene me doe, make haste, \add and\add* doe as I \add haue done\add*.
\v 49 And all the people likewise cut downe euery man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put \add them\add* to the holde, and set the holde on fire vpon them: so that all the men of the towre of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.
\v 50 ¶ Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and tooke it.
\v 51 But there was a strong towre within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the citie, and shut \add it\add* to them, and gate them vp to the top of the towre.
\v 52 And Abimelech came vnto the towre, and fought against it, and went hard vnto the doore of the towre, to burne it with fire.
\v 53 \f + \fr 9:53 \ft 2.Sam. 11.21.\f*And a certaine woman cast a piece of a milstone vpon Abimelechs head, and all to brake his scull.
\v 54 Then hee called hastily vnto the young man his armour-bearer, and said vnto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A woman slewe him: and his young man thrust him through, and he died.
\v 55 And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed euery man vnto his place.
\v 56 ¶ Thus God rendred the wickednesse of Abimelech which hee did vnto his father, in slaying his seuentie brethren.
\v 57 And all the euill of the men of Shechem, did God render vpon their heads: and vpon them came the curse of Iotham the sonne of Ierubbaal.

\v 7 And Iephthah said vnto the Elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me, and expell me out of my fathers house? And why are ye come vnto mee now when ye are in distresse?
\v 8 And the Elders of Gilead said vnto Iephthah, Therefore we turne againe to thee now, that thou mayest go with vs, and fight against the children of Ammon, and bee our head ouer all the inhabitants of Gilead.

\v 18 And these went into Micahs house, and fetched the carued image, the Ephod, and the Teraphim, and the molten image: then said the Priest vnto them, What doe ye?
\v 19 And they said vnto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand vpon thy mouth, and goe with vs, and bee to vs a father and a Priest: Is it better for thee to bee a Priest vnto the house of one man, or that thou be a Priest vnto a tribe and a family in Israel?
\v 20 And the Priests heart was glad, and he tooke the Ephod, and the Teraphim, and the grauen image, and went in the middest of the people.

\v 32 And the children of Beniamin said, They \add are\add* smitten downe before vs, as at the first: But the children of Israel said, Let vs flee, and draw them from the citie, vnto the high wayes.

\v 4 And it came to passe on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an Altar, and offered burnt offerings, and peace offerings.
\v 5 And the children of Israel sayd, Who \add is there\add* among all the tribes of Israel, that came not vp with the congregation vnto the \nd LORD\nd*? for they had made a great oath concerning him that came not vp to the \nd LORD\nd* to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.
