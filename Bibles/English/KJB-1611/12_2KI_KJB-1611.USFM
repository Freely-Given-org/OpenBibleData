\iex 1 Moab rebelleth. 2 Ahaziah, sending to Baalzebub, hath his iudgement by Eliiah. 5 Eliiah twise bringeth fire from heauen vpon them whom Ahaziah sent to apprehend him. 13 He pitieth the third captaine, and incouraged by an Angel, telleth the King of his death. 17 Iehoram succeedeth Ahaziah.
\v 1 ¶ Then Moab rebelled against Israel, \f + \fr 1:1 \ft Chap.3. 5.\f*after the death of Ahab.
\v 2 And Ahaziah fel downe thorow a lattesse in his vpper chamber that \add was\add* in Samaria, and was sicke: and he sent messengers, and said vnto them, Goe, enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, whether I shal recouer of this disease.
\v 3 But the Angel of the \nd LORD\nd* said to Eliiah the Tishbite, Arise, goe vp to meete the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say vnto them, \add Is it\add* not because \add there is\add* not a God in Israel, \add that\add* ye goe to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?
\v 4 Now therefore, thus sayeth the \nd LORD\nd*, \f + \fr 1:4 \ft Heb. the bed, whither thou art gone vp, thou shalt not come downe from it.\f*Thou shalt not come downe from that bed on which thou art gone vp, but shalt surely die. And Eliiah departed.
\v 5 ¶ And when the messengers turned backe vnto him, he said vnto them, Why are ye now turned backe?
\v 6 And they said vnto him, There came a man vp to meet vs, and said vnto vs, Goe, turne againe vnto the king that sent you, and say vnto him, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, \add Is it\add* not because \add there is\add* not a God in Israel, \add that\add* thou sendest to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come downe from that bedde on which thou art gone vp, but shalt surely die.
\v 7 And hee said vnto them, \f + \fr 1:7 \ft Heb. what was the maner of the man?\f*What maner of man \add was he\add* which came vp to meet you, and told you these words?
\v 8 And they answered him, \add He was\add* an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loynes: and he said, It \add is\add* Eliiah the Tishbite.
\v 9 Then the King sent vnto him a captaine of fiftie, with his fiftie: and he went vp to him, (and behold, he sate on the top of an hill) and hee spake vnto him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come downe.
\v 10 And Eliiah answered, and said to the captaine of fiftie, If I \add be\add* a man of God, then let fire come downe from heauen, and consume thee and thy fiftie. And there came downe fire from heauen, and consumed him and his fiftie.
\v 11 Againe also hee sent vnto him another captaine of fiftie, with his fiftie: And hee answered, and said vnto him, O man of God, Thus hath the king said, Come downe quickly.
\v 12 And Eliiah answered, and saide vnto them, If I \add be\add* a man of God, let fire come downe from heauen, and consume thee, and thy fiftie. And the fire of God came downe from heauen, and consumed him, and his fiftie.
\v 13 ¶ And hee sent againe a captaine of the third fiftie, with his fiftie: and the third captaine of fiftie went vp, and came and \f + \fr 1:13 \ft Hebr. bowed.\f*fell on his knees before Eliiah, and besought him, and saide vnto him, Oh man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fiftie thy seruants, be precious in thy sight.
\v 14 Behold, there came fire downe from heauen, and burnt vp the two captaines of the former fifties, with their fifties: Therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight.
\v 15 And the Angel of the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Elijah, Goe downe with him, be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went downe with him vnto the king.
\v 16 And he said vnto him, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron (\add is it\add* not because \add there is\add* no God in Israel, to enquire of his word?) therefore thou shalt not come downe off that bed on which thou art gone vp, but shalt surely die.
\v 17 ¶ So he died, according to the worde of the \nd LORD\nd* which Eliiah had spoken: and Iehoram reigned in his stead, in the second yeere of Iehoram the sonne of Iehoshaphat king of Iudah, because he had no sonne.
\v 18 Now the rest of the actes of Ahaziah, which hee did, \add are\add* they not written in the booke of the Chronicles of the kings of Israel?

\iex 1 Elijah, taking his leaue of Elisha, with his mantle diuideth Iordan, 9 and granting Elisha his request, is taken vp by a fierie charet into heauen. 12 Elisha, diuiding Iordan with Elijahs mantle, is acknowledged his successor. 16 The young prophets, hardly obtaining leaue to seeke Elijah, could not finde him. 19 Elisha with salt, healeth the vnwholesome waters. 23 Beares destroy the children that mocked Elisha.
\v 1 ¶ And it came to passe when the \nd LORD\nd* would take vp Elijah into heauen by a whirlewinde, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.
\v 2 And Elijah said vnto Elisha, Tarie here, I pray thee: for the \nd LORD\nd* hath sent me to Bethel: and Elisha said vnto him, As the \nd LORD\nd* liueth, and as thy soule liueth, I wil not leaue thee. So they went downe to Bethel.
\v 3 And the sonnes of the Prophets that \add were\add* at Bethel, came foorth to Elisha, and said vnto him, Knowest thou that the \nd LORD\nd* will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know \add it\add*, hold you your peace.
\v 4 And Elijah said vnto him, Elisha, tarie here, I pray thee: for the \nd LORD\nd* hath sent me to Iericho: And hee said, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liueth, and \add as\add* thy soule liueth, I will not leaue thee. So they came to Iericho.
\v 5 And the sonnes of the Prophets that \add were\add* at Iericho came to Elisha, and said vnto him, Knowest thou that the \nd LORD\nd* will take away thy master from thy head to day? And hee answered, Yea, I knowe \add it\add*, holde you your peace.
\v 6 And Elijah said vnto him, Tarie, I pray thee, here: for the \nd LORD\nd* hath sent me to Iordan. And he said, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liueth, and \add as\add* thy soule liueth, I will not leaue thee. And they two went on.
\v 7 And fiftie men of the sonnes of the Prophets went, and stood \f + \fr 2:7 \ft Hebr. in sight, or ouer against.\f*to view afarre off: and they two stood by Iordan.
\v 8 And Elijah tooke his mantle, and wrapt \add it\add* together, and smote the waters, and they were diuided hither and thither, so that they two went ouer on drie ground.
\v 9 ¶ And it came to passe when they were gone ouer, that Elijah said vnto Elisha, Aske what I shall doe for thee, before I be taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be vpon me.
\v 10 And hee said, \f + \fr 2:10 \ft Hebr. thou hast done hard in asking.\f*Thou hast asked a hard thing: neuerthelesse, if thou see me, \add when I am\add* taken from thee, it shall be \add so\add* vnto thee: but if not, it shall not be so.
\v 11 And it came to passe as they still went on and talked, that beholde, \add there appeared\add* a charet of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder, and \f + \fr 2:11 \ft Ecclus.48 9. 1. mac.2. 58.\f*Elijah went vp by a whirlewind into heauen.
\v 12 ¶ And Elisha saw \add it\add*, and he cried, \f + \fr 2:12 \ft Chap.13. 14.\f*My father, my father, the charet of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he tooke hold of his owne cloathes, and rent them in two pieces.
\v 13 He tooke vp also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the \f + \fr 2:13 \ft Hebr. lip.\f*banke of Iordan.
\v 14 And he tooke the mantle of Eliiah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where \add is\add* the \nd LORD\nd* God of Elijah? And when hee also had smitten the waters, they parted hither and thither: and Elisha went ouer.
\v 15 And when the sonnes of the Prophets which \add were\add* \f + \fr 2:15 \ft Verse 7.\f*to view at Iericho, saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha: And they came to meet him, and bowed themselues to the ground before him.
\v 16 ¶ \f + \fr 2:16 \ft Hebr. sonnes of strength.\f*\f + \fr 2:16 \ft Hebr. one of the mountaines.\f*And they said vnto him, Behold now, there bee with thy seruants fiftie strong men, let them goe, we pray thee, and seeke thy master: lest peraduenture the Spirit of the \nd LORD\nd* hath taken him vp, and cast him vpon some mountaine, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send.
\v 17 And when they vrged him, till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fiftie men, and they sought three dayes, but found him not.
\v 18 And when they came againe to him (for he taried at Iericho) hee said vnto them, Did I not say vnto you, Goe not?
\v 19 ¶ \f + \fr 2:19 \ft Hebr. causing to miscary.\f*And the men of the city said vnto Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city \add is\add* pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water \add is\add* nought, and the ground barren.
\v 20 And hee said, Bring mee a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought \add it\add* to him.
\v 21 And he went forth vnto the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, I haue healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death, or barren \add land\add*.
\v 22 So the waters were healed vnto this day, according to the saying of Elisha, which he spake.
\v 23 ¶ And he went vp from thence vnto Bethel: and as hee was going vp by the way, there came foorth little children out of the citie, and mocked him, and said vnto him, Goe vp thou bald head, Goe vp thou bald head.
\v 24 And hee turned backe, and looked on them, and cursed them in the Name of the \nd LORD\nd*: and there came foorth two shee Beares out of the wood, and tare fortie and two children of them.
\v 25 And hee went from thence to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.

\iex 1 Iehorams reigne. 4 Mesha rebelleth. 6 Iehoram, with Iehoshaphat, and the king of Edom, being distressed for want of water, by Elisha obtaineth water, and promise of victory. 21 The Moabites deceiued by the colour of the water, comming to spoile, are ouercome. 26 The king of Moab, by sacrificing the king of Edoms sonne, raiseth the siege.
\v 1 ¶ Now Iehoram the sonne of Ahab began to reigne ouer Israel in Samaria, the eighteenth yere of Iehoshaphat king of Iudah, and reigned twelue yeeres.
\v 2 \f + \fr 3:2 \ft Hebr. statue.\f*And he wrought euill in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, but not like his father and like his mother; for hee put away the image of Baal that his father had made.
\v 3 Neuerthelesse, hee cleaued vnto the sinnes of Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat, which made Israel to sinne; he departed not therefrom.
\v 4 ¶ And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepe-master, and rendred vnto the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambes, and an hundred thousand rammes, with the wooll.
\v 5 \f + \fr 3:5 \ft Chap.1. 1.\f*But it came to passe when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
\v 6 ¶ And king Iehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbred all Israel.
\v 7 \f + \fr 3:7 \ft 1.King. 22.4.\f*And he went, and sent to Iehoshaphat the King of Iudah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against mee: Wilt thou goe with mee against Moab to battell? and he said, I will goe vp: I \add am\add* as thou \add art\add*, my people as thy people, \add and\add* my horses as thy horses.
\v 8 And he said, Which way shall we goe vp? And he answered, The way through the wildernesse of Edom.
\v 9 \f + \fr 3:9 \ft Hebr. at their feet.\f*So the king of Israel went, and the king of Iudah, and the king of Edom: and they fetcht a compasse of seuen dayes iourney: and there was no water for the hoste, and for the cattell that followed them.
\v 10 And the king of Israel said, Alas, that the \nd LORD\nd* hath called these three kings together, to deliuer them into the hand of Moab.
\v 11 But Iehoshaphat said, \add Is there\add* not here a Prophet of the \nd LORD\nd*, that we may enquire of the \nd LORD\nd* by him? And one of the king of Israels seruants answered, and said, Here \add is\add* Elisha the sonne of Shaphat, which powred water on the hands of Eliiah.
\v 12 And Iehoshaphat saide, The word of the \nd LORD\nd* is with him. So the king of Israel, & Iehoshaphat, and the king of Edom went downe to him.
\v 13 And Elisha saide vnto the king of Israel, What haue I to doe with thee? Get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said vnto him, Nay: for the \nd LORD\nd* hath called these three kings together, to deliuer them into the hand of Moab.
\v 14 And Elisha said, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* of hostes liueth, before whom I stand, Surely were it not that I regard the presence of Iehoshaphat the King of Iudah, I would not looke toward thee, nor see thee.
\v 15 But now bring me a minstrell. And it came to passe when the minstrell played, that the hand of the \nd LORD\nd* came vpon him.
\v 16 And hee sayde, Thus sayth the \nd LORD\nd*, Make this valley full of ditches.
\v 17 For thus sayth the \nd LORD\nd*, Yee shall not see winde, neither shall ye see raine, yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drinke, both ye, and your cattell, and your beasts.
\v 18 And this is \add but\add* a light thing in the sight of the \nd LORD\nd*, he will deliuer the Moabites also into your hand.
\v 19 \f + \fr 3:19 \ft Heb. grieue\f*And ye shall smite euery fenced citie, and euery choice citie, and shall fell euery good tree, and stop all welles of water, and marre euery good piece of land with stones.
\v 20 And it came to passe in the morning when the meate offering was offered, that behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the countrey was filled with water.
\v 21 ¶ \f + \fr 3:21 \ft Heb. were cryed together.\f*\f + \fr 3:21 \ft Heb. gird himselfe with a girdle.\f*And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come vp to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and vpward, and stood in the border.
\v 22 And they rose vp early in the morning, and the Sunne shone vpon the water, and the Moabites sawe the water on the other side \add as\add* red as blood.
\v 23 \f + \fr 3:23 \ft Heb. destroyed.\f*And they said, This \add is\add* blood: the kings are surely slaine, and they haue smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoile.
\v 24 \f + \fr 3:24 \ft Or, they smote in it, euen smiting.\f*And when they came to the campe of Israel, the Israelites rose vp and smote the Moabites, so that they fledde before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, euen in \add their\add* countrey.
\v 25 \f + \fr 3:25 \ft Heb. vntill he left the stones thereof in Kirharaseth.\f*And they beat downe the cities, and on euery good piece of land cast euery man his stone, and filled it, and they stopped all the welles of water, and felled all the good trees: onely in Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof: howbeit the slingers went about \add it\add*, and smote it.
\v 26 ¶ And when the king of Moab sawe that the battell was too sore for him, he tooke with him seuen hundred men that drewe swordes, to breake thorow \add euen\add* vnto the king of Edom: but they could not.
\v 27 Then hee tooke his eldest sonne that should haue reigned in his stead, and offered him \add for\add* a burnt offering vpon the wall: and there was great indignation against Israel, and they departed from him, and returned to their owne land.

\iex 1 Elisha multiplieth the widowes oyle. 8 Hee giueth a sonne to the good Shunammite. 18 Hee raiseth againe her dead sonne. 38 At Gilgal hee healeth the deadly pottage. 42 Hee satisfieth an hundred men with twentie loaues.
\v 1 ¶ Now there cryed a certaine woman of the wiues of the sonnes of the Prophets vnto Elisha, saying, Thy seruant my husband is dead, and thou knowest that thy seruant did feare the \nd LORD\nd*: and the creditour is come to take vnto him my two sonnes to be bondmen.
\v 2 And Elisha said vnto her, What shall I doe for thee? Tell mee, what hast thou in the house? And shee sayd, Thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house, saue a pot of oyle.
\v 3 \f + \fr 4:3 \ft Or, scant not.\f*Then hee said, Goe, borrow thee vessels abroad, of all thy neighbours; \add euen\add* emptie vessels, borrow not a few.
\v 4 And when thou art come in, thou shalt shut the doore vpon thee, and vpon thy sonnes, and shalt powre out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full.
\v 5 So shee went from him, and shut the doore vpon her, & vpon her sonnes: who brought \add the vessels\add* to her, and shee powred out.
\v 6 And it came to passe, when the vessels were full, that shee said vnto her sonne, Bring me yet a vessell. And hee said vnto her, \add There is\add* not a vessel more. And the oyle stayed.
\v 7 \f + \fr 4:7 \ft Or, creditour.\f*Then she came, and told the man of God: and he said, Goe, sell the oyle, and pay thy debt, and liue thou and thy children of the rest.
\v 8 ¶ \f + \fr 4:8 \ft Heb. there was a day.\f*\f + \fr 4:8 \ft Heb. laid hold on him.\f*And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where \add was\add* a great woman; and shee constrained him to eate bread: And \add so\add* it was, \add that\add* as oft as he passed by, hee turned in thither to eate bread.
\v 9 And shee said vnto her husband, Behold now, I perceiue that th\add is\add* is an holy man of God, which passeth by vs continually.
\v 10 Let vs make a litle chamber, I pray thee, on the wall, and let vs set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stoole, and a candlesticke: and it shall be when he commeth to vs, that hee shall turne in thither.
\v 11 And it fell on a day that hee came thither, and hee turned into the chamber, and lay there.
\v 12 And he said to Gehazi his seruant, Call this Shunammite. And when hee had called her, she stood before him.
\v 13 And he said vnto him, Say, now vnto her, Behold, thou hast beene carefull for vs with all this care; What \add is\add* to be done for thee? Wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captaine of the hoste? And she answered, I dwell among mine owne people.
\v 14 And he said, What then \add is\add* to bee done for her? And Gehazi answered, Uerily she hath no child, and her husband is old.
\v 15 And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the doore.
\v 16 \f + \fr 4:16 \ft Gen. 18. 10.\f*\f + \fr 4:16 \ft Heb. set time.\f*And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, thou shalt imbrace a sonne. And she said, Nay my lord, \add thou\add* man of God, doe not lie vnto thine handmaid.
\v 17 And the woman conceiued, and bare a sonne at that season, that Elisha had said vnto her, according to the time of life.
\v 18 ¶ And when the child was growen, it fell on a day that hee went out to his father, to the reapers.
\v 19 And he said vnto his father, My head, my head: and he said to a ladde, Carie him to his mother.
\v 20 And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, hee sate on her knees till noone, and \add then\add* died.
\v 21 And she went vp, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the doore vpon him, and went out.
\v 22 And she called vnto her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the yong men, and one of the asses, that I may runne to the man of God, and come againe.
\v 23 \f + \fr 4:23 \ft Heb. peace.\f*And he said, Wherefore wilt thou goe to him to day? \add it is\add* neither newe moone nor Sabbath. And shee said, It shalbe well.
\v 24 \f + \fr 4:24 \ft Heb. restraine not for me to ride.\f*Then she sadled an asse, and said to her seruant, Driue, and goe forward: slacke not \add thy\add* riding for mee, except I bid thee.
\v 25 So she went, and came vnto the man of God to mount Carmel: and it came to passe when the man of God saw her afarre off, that hee said to Gehazi his seruant, Behold, \add yonder is\add* that Shunammite:
\v 26 Runne now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say vnto her, \add Is it\add* wel with thee? \add is it\add* wel with thy husband? \add is it\add* wel with the child? And she answered, \add It is\add* well.
\v 27 \f + \fr 4:27 \ft Heb. by his feete.\f*\f + \fr 4:27 \ft Heb. bitter\f*And when shee came to the man of God to the hill, shee caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came neere to thrust her away. And the man of God saide, Let her alone, for her soule \add is\add* vexed within her: and the \nd LORD\nd* hath hid \add it\add* from me, and hath not told me.
\v 28 Then shee said, Did I desire a sonne of my \nd LORD\nd*? did I not say, Doe not deceiue me?
\v 29 Then he said to Gehazi, Gird vp thy loines, and take my staffe in thine hand, and goe thy way: if thou meete any man, salute him not: and if any salute thee, answere him not againe: and lay my staffe vpon the face of the childe.
\v 30 And the mother of the childe said, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liueth, and \add as\add* thy soule liueth, I will not leaue thee. And he arose, and followed her.
\v 31 \f + \fr 4:31 \ft Heb. attention.\f*And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staffe vpon the face of the child, but \add there was\add* neither voyce, nor hearing: wherefore he went againe to meete him, and tolde him, saying, The child is not awaked.
\v 32 And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, \add and\add* laid vpon his bed.
\v 33 He went in therefore, and shut the doore vpon them twaine, and prayed vnto the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 34 And he went vp, and lay vpon the child, and put his mouth vpon his mouth, and his eyes vpon his eyes, and his hands vpon his hands, and he stretched himselfe vpon the child, and the flesh of the child waxed warme.
\v 35 \f + \fr 4:35 \ft Heb. once hither, and once thither.\f*Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro, and went vp, and stretched himselfe vpon him: and the child neesed seuen times, and the child opened his eyes.
\v 36 And hee called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So hee called her: and when shee was come in vnto him, he said, Take vp thy sonne.
\v 37 Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed her selfe to the ground, and tooke vp her sonne, and went out.
\v 38 ¶ And Elisha came againe to Gilgal, and \add there was\add* a dearth in the land, and the sonnes of the Prophets \add were\add* sitting before him: and hee said vnto his seruant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sonnes of the Prophets.
\v 39 And one went out into the field to gather herbes, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wilde gourds his lap full, and came and shred \add them\add* into the pot of pottage: for they knew \add them\add* not.
\v 40 So they powred out for the men to eat: and it came to passe as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O \add thou\add* man of God, \add there is\add* death in the pot. And they could not eate \add thereof\add*.
\v 41 \f + \fr 4:41 \ft Hebr. euil thing.\f*But he said, Then bring meale. And he cast \add it\add* into the pot: And he said, Powre out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harme in the pot.
\v 42 ¶ \f + \fr 4:42 \ft Or, in his scrip, or garment.\f*And there came a man from Baal-Shalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, twentie loaues of barley, and full eares of corne in the huske thereof: and he said, Giue vnto the people, that they may eate.
\v 43 \f + \fr 4:43 \ft Iohn 6. 11.\f*And his seruitour saide, What should I set this before an hundred men? He said againe, Giue the people, that they may eate: for thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, They shall eate, and shall leaue \add thereof\add*.
\v 44 So he set \add it\add* before them, and they did eate, and left \add thereof\add*, according to the word of the \nd LORD\nd*.

\v 6 And hee brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying, Now when this letter is come vnto thee, behold, I haue \add therewith\add* sent Naaman my seruant to thee, that thou mayest recouer him of his leprosie.
\v 7 And it came to passe when the king of Israel had read the letter, that he rent his clothes, and said, \add Am\add* I God, to kill and to make aliue, that this man doeth send vnto me, to recouer a man of his leprosie? Wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrell against me.
\v 8 ¶ And it was \add so\add* when Elisha the man of God had heard, that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, that he sent to the king, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? Let him come now to mee, and he shall know that there is a Prophet in Israel.
\v 9 So Naaman came with his horses, and with his charet, and stood at the doore of the house of Elisha.
\v 10 And Elisha sent a messenger vnto him, saying, Goe and wash in Iordane seuen times, and thy flesh shall come againe to thee, and thou shalt be cleane.
\v 11 \f + \fr 5:11 \ft Hebr. said. Or, I said with my selfe, He will surely come out &c.\f*\f + \fr 5:11 \ft Hebr. mooue vp and downe.\f*But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and saide, Beholde, I thought, He will surely come out to me and stand, and call on the Name of the \nd LORD\nd* his God, and strike his hand ouer the place, and recouer the leper.
\v 12 \f + \fr 5:12 \ft Or, Amana.\f*\add Are\add* not Abana and Pharpar, riuers of Damascus, better then all the waters of Israel? May I not wash in them, and be cleane? So he turned, and went away in a rage.
\v 13 And his seruants came neere and spake vnto him, and said, My father, If the Prophet had bid thee do some great thing, wouldest thou not haue done it? How much rather then, when hee saith to thee, Wash and be cleane?
\v 14 \f + \fr 5:14 \ft Luke 4. 27.\f*Then went he downe, and dipped himselfe seuen times in Iordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came againe like vnto the flesh of a litle childe, and he was cleane.
\v 15 ¶ And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came, and stood before him: and he said, Behold, now I know that \add there is\add* no God in all the earth, but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy seruant.
\v 16 But he said, \add As\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liueth, before whom I stand, I will receiue none: And hee vrged him to take \add it\add*, but he refused.
\v 17 And Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be giuen to thy seruant two mules burden of earth? for thy seruant wil henceforth offer neither burnt offering, nor sacrifice vnto other gods, but vnto the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 18 In this thing the \nd LORD\nd* pardon thy seruant, \add that\add* when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon to worship there, and hee leaneth on my hand, and I bow myselfe in the house of Rimmon: when I bow downe my selfe in the house of Rimmon, the \nd LORD\nd* pardon thy seruant in this thing.
\v 19 \f + \fr 5:19 \ft Hebr. a litle piece of ground.\f*And he said vnto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him, a litle way.
\v 20 ¶ But Gehazi the seruant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master hath spared Naaman this Syrian, in not receiuing at his hands that which hee brought: but \add as\add* the \nd LORD\nd* liueth, I wil runne after him, and take somewhat of him.
\v 21 \f + \fr 5:21 \ft Hebr. Is there peace?\f*So Gehazi followed after Naaman: and when Naaman saw \add him\add* running after him, hee lighted downe from the charet to meet him, and said, \add Is\add* all well?
\v 22 And he said, All \add is\add* well: my master hath sent me, saying, Behold, euen now there be come to mee from mount Ephraim two yong men, of the sonnes of the Prophets: Giue them, I pray thee, a talent of siluer, and two changes of garments.
\v 23 And Naaman said, Bee content, take two talents: and hee vrged him, and bound two talents of siluer in two bags, with two changes of garments, and layde \add them\add* vpon two of his seruants, and they bare \add them\add* before him.
\v 24 \f + \fr 5:24 \ft Or, secret place.\f*And when he came to the towre, he tooke \add them\add* from their hand, and bestowed \add them\add* in the house, and hee let the men goe, and they departed.
\v 25 \f + \fr 5:25 \ft Hebr. Not hither or thither.\f*But he went in, and stood before his master: and Elisha said vnto him, Whence commest thou, Gehazi? And hee said, Thy seruant went no whither.
\v 26 And he said vnto him, Went not mine heart \add with thee\add*, when the man turned againe from his charet to meete thee? \add Is it\add* a time to receiue money, and to receiue garments, and Oliue yards, and Uineyards, and sheepe, and oxen, and men seruants, and mayd seruants?
\v 27 The leprosie therefore of Naaman shall cleaue vnto thee, and vnto thy seede for euer: And hee went out from his presence a leper \add as white\add* as snow.

\iex 1 Elisha giuing leaue to the yong Prophets to inlarge their dwellings, causeth yron to swim. 8 Hee discloseth the king of Syria his counsell. 13 The armie which was sent to Dothan to apprehend Elisha, is smitten with blindnesse: 19 Being brought into Samaria, they are dismissed in peace. 24 The famine in Samaria, causeth women to eate their owne children. 30 The king sendeth to slay Elisha.
\v 1 ¶ And the sonnes of the Prophets saide vnto Elisha, Beholde now, the place where wee dwell with thee, is too strait for vs:
\v 2 Let vs goe, wee pray thee, vnto Iordane, and take thence euery man a beame, and let vs make vs a place there where we may dwell. And hee answered, Goe ye.
\v 3 And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and goe with thy seruants. And he answered, I will goe.
\v 4 So hee went with them: and when they came to Iordane, they cut downe wood.
\v 5 \f + \fr 6:5 \ft Heb. yron.\f*But as one was felling a beame, the axe head fell into the water: and hee cryed, and sayd, Alas master, for it was borrowed.
\v 6 And the man of God said, Where fell it? and hee shewed him the place: and he cut downe a sticke, and cast \add it\add* in thither, and the yron did swimme.
\v 7 Therefore said he, Take \add it\add* vp to thee: And hee put out his hand, and tooke it.
\v 8 ¶ \f + \fr 6:8 \ft Or, encamping.\f*Then the king of Syria warred against Israel, and tooke counsell with his seruants, saying, In such and such a place \add shall be\add* my campe.
\v 9 And the man of God sent vnto the king of Israel, saying, Beware that thou passe not such a place; for thither the Syrians are come downe.
\v 10 And the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God tolde him, and warned him of, and saued himselfe there, not once nor twise.
\v 11 Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing, and he called his seruants, and said vnto them, Will ye not shewe me which of vs \add is\add* for the king of Israel?
\v 12 \f + \fr 6:12 \ft Heb. No.\f*And one of his seruants sayde, None, my lord O king; but Elisha the Prophet, that \add is\add* in Israel, telleth the king of Israel, the wordes that thou speakest in thy bed-chamber.
\v 13 ¶ And he said, Goe and spie where he \add is\add*, that I may send and fetch him. And it was tolde him, saying, Behold, \add he is\add* in Dothan.
\v 14 \f + \fr 6:14 \ft Heb. heauie.\f*Therefore sent he thither horses, and charets, and a great hoste: and they came by night, and compassed the citie about.
\v 15 \f + \fr 6:15 \ft Or, minister.\f*And when the seruant of the man of God was risen early and gone forth, behold, an host compassed the citie, both with horses and charets: and his seruant said vnto him, Alas my master, how shall we doe?
\v 16 \f + \fr 6:16 \ft 2. Chron. 32.7.\f*And he answered, Feare not: for they that \add be\add* with vs, \add are\add* moe then they that \add be\add* with them.
\v 17 And Elisha prayed, and sayde, \nd LORD\nd*, I pray thee, open his eyes that he may see. And the \nd LORD\nd* opened the eyes of the young man, and hee saw: and behold, the mountaine \add was\add* full of horses, and charets of fire round about Elisha.
\v 18 And when they came downe to him, Elisha prayed vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, and said, Smite this people, I pray thee, with blindnesse. And hee smote them with blindnesse, according to the word of Elisha.
\v 19 ¶ \f + \fr 6:19 \ft Heb. come ye after me.\f*And Elisha saide vnto them, Th\add is\add* \add is\add* not the way, neither is this the citie: follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seeke. But hee led them to Samaria.
\v 20 And it came to passe when they were come into Samaria, that Elisha said, \nd LORD\nd*, open the eyes of these \add men\add*, that they may see. And the \nd LORD\nd* opened their eyes, and they saw, and beholde, \add they were\add* in the mids of Samaria.
\v 21 And the king of Israel saide vnto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite \add them\add*? shall I smite \add them\add*?
\v 22 And he answered, Thou shalt not smite \add them\add*: wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captiue with thy sword, and with thy bow? set bread and water before them, that they may eate, and drinke, and go to their master.
\v 23 And hee prepared great prouision for them, and when they had eaten and drunke, hee sent them away, and they went to their master: so the bands of Syria came no more into the lande of Israel.
\v 24 ¶ And it came to passe after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his hoste, and went vp, and besieged Samaria.
\v 25 And there was a great famine in Samaria: and behold, they besieged it, vntill an asses head was solde for fourescore \add pieces\add* of siluer, and the fourth part of a kab of doues doung for fiue \add pieces\add* of siluer.
\v 26 And as the king of Israel was passing by vpon the wall, there cried a woman vnto him, saying, Helpe, my lord, O king.
\v 27 \f + \fr 6:27 \ft Or, Let not the \nd LORD\nd* saue thee\f*And he said, If the \nd LORD\nd* do not helpe thee, whence shall I helpe thee? out of the barne floore, or out of the wine presse?
\v 28 And the king said vnto her, What aileth thee? And shee answered, This woman said vnto me, Giue thy sonne, that we may eate him to day, and wee will eate my sonne to morrow.
\v 29 \f + \fr 6:29 \ft Deut 28. 53.\f*\f + \fr 6:29 \ft Heb. other.\f*So we boyled my sonne, and did eate him: and I saide vnto her on the next day, Giue thy sonne, that we may eate him: and she hath hid her sonne.
\v 30 ¶ And it came to passe when the king heard the words of the woman, that he rent his clothes, and hee passed by vpon the wall, and the people looked, and behold, hee had sackcloth within, vpon his flesh.
\v 31 Then he said, God doe so, and more also to mee, if the head of Elisha the sonne of Shaphat, shall stand on him this day.
\v 32 But Elisha sate in his house (and the elders sate with him) and the king sent a man from before him: but yer the messenger came to him, hee said to the Elders, See yee how this sonne of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head? Looke when the messenger commeth, shut the doore, and hold him fast at the doore: Is not the sound of his masters feete behind him?
\v 33 And while hee yet talked with them, beholde, the messenger came downe vnto him: and he said, Behold, this euill \add is\add* of the \nd LORD\nd*, what should I waite for the \nd LORD\nd* any longer?

\iex 1 Elisha prophecieth incredible plenty in Samaria. 3 Foure Lepers venturing on the host of the Syrians, bring tydings of their flight. 22 The king finding by spies the newes to be true, spoileth the tents of the Syrians. 17 The \nd LORD\nd*, who would not beleeue the prophecy of plenty, hauing the charge of the gate, is troden to death in the presse.
\v 1 ¶ Then Elisha said, Heare yee the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, To morrowe about this time shal a measure of fine flower \add be sold\add* for a shekell, and two measures of barley for a shekel, in the gate of Samaria.
\v 2 \f + \fr 7:2 \ft Heb. a \nd LORD\nd* which belonged to the King, leaning vpon his hand.\f*Then a lord on whose hand the king leaned, answered the man of God, and said, Behold, \add if\add* the \nd LORD\nd* would make windowes in heauen, might this thing bee? and he saide, Behold, thou shalt see \add it\add* with thine eies, but shalt not eate thereof.
\v 3 ¶ And there were foure leprous men at the entring in of the gate: and they saide one to another, Why sit wee here vntill we die?
\v 4 If we say, We will enter into the citie, then the famine \add is\add* in the citie, and wee shall die there: and if we sit still here, we die also. Now therefore come, and let vs fall vnto the host of the Syrians: if they saue vs aliue, we shall liue; and if they kill vs, we shall but die.
\v 5 And they rose vp in the twilight, to goe vnto the campe of the Syrians: and when they were come to the vttermost part of the campe of Syria, behold, \add there was\add* no man there.
\v 6 For the \nd LORD\nd* had made the host of the Syrians to heare a noise of charets, and a noise of horses, \add euen\add* the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Loe, the king of Israel hath hired against vs the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come vpon vs.
\v 7 Wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight, and left their tents, and their horses, and their asses, euen the campe as it \add was\add*, and fled for their life.
\v 8 And when these lepers came to the vttermost part of the campe, they went into one tent, and did eate, and drinke, and carried thence siluer, and gold, and raiment, and went and hid \add it\add*, and came againe, and entred into another tent, and carried thence \add also\add*, and went and hid \add it\add*.
\v 9 \f + \fr 7:9 \ft Heb. we shall find punishment.\f*Then they said one to another, We doe not well: this day \add is\add* a day of good tydings, and we hold our peace: if we tarie till the morning light, some mischiefe will come vpon vs: nowe therefore come, that we may goe, and tell the kings houshold.
\v 10 So they came, and called vnto the porter of the citie: and they told them, saying; We came to the campe of the Syrians, and behold, \add there was\add* no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tyed, and asses tyed, and the tents as they \add were\add*.
\v 11 And hee called the porters, and they told \add it\add* to the kings house within.
\v 12 ¶ And the king arose in the night, and said vnto his seruants, I will now shew you what the Syrians haue done to vs: They know that we \add be\add* hungrie, therefore are they gone out of the camp, to hide themselues in the field, saying; When they come out of the citie, we shal catch them aliue, and get into the citie.
\v 13 \f + \fr 7:13 \ft Heb. in it.\f*And one of his seruants answered, and said, Let \add some\add* take, I pray thee, fiue of the horses that remaine, which \add are\add* left in the citie: (behold, they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it: behold, \add I say\add*, they \add are\add* euen as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed) and let vs send, and see.
\v 14 They tooke therefore two charet horses, and the king sent after the hoste of the Syrians, saying, Goe, and see.
\v 15 And they went after them vnto Iordane, and loe, all the way \add was\add* full of garments, and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste: and the messengers returned, and told the king.
\v 16 And the people went out, and spoiled the tents of the Syrians: So a measure of fine flowre was \add sold\add* for a shekell, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 17 ¶ And the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned, to haue the charge of the gate: and the people trode vpon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spake when the king came downe to him.
\v 18 And it came to passe, as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flowre for a shekel, shalbe to morrow about this time, in the gate of Samaria:
\v 19 And that lord answered the man of God, and said, Now behold, \add if\add* the \nd LORD\nd* should make windowes in heauen, might such a thing be? And he said, Behold, thou shalt see it with thine eyes, but shalt not eate thereof.
\v 20 And so it fell out vnto him: for the people trode vpon him in the gate, and he died.

\v 2 And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God: and she went with her housholde, and soiourned in the land of the Philistines seuen yeeres.
\v 3 And it came to passe at the seuen yeeres ende, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went foorth to crie vnto the king for her house, and for her land.
\v 4 And the king talked with Gehazi the seruant of the man of God, saying, Tell mee, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done.
\v 5 And it came to passe as he was telling the King how hee had restored a dead body to life, that behold, the woman whose sonne he had restored to life, cryed to the King for her house and for her land.

\v 13 And Hazael said, But what, \add is\add* thy seruant a dogge, that he should doe this great thing? And Elisha answered, The \nd LORD\nd* hath shewed mee that thou \add shalt be\add* king ouer Syria.

\v 8 And walked in the statutes of the heathen, (whom the \nd LORD\nd* cast out from before the children of Israel) and of the kings of Israel, which they had made.

\v 14 Notwithstanding, they would not heare, but hardened their neckes, like to the necke of their fathers, that did not beleeue in the \nd LORD\nd* their God.
\v 15 And they reiected his Statutes, and his Couenant that hee made with their fathers, and his Testimonies which he testified against them, and they followed vanitie, and became vaine, and went after the heathen that \add were\add* round about them, \add concerning\add* whom the \nd LORD\nd* had charged them, that they should not doe like them.

\v 20 And the \nd LORD\nd* reiected all the seed of Israel, and afflicted them, and deliuered them into the hand of spoilers, vntill he had cast them out of his sight.
\v 21 For he rent Israel from the house of Dauid, and they made Ieroboam the sonne of Nebat king, and Ieroboam draue Israel from following the \nd LORD\nd*, and made them sinne a great sinne.
\v 22 For the children of Israel walked in al the sinnes of Ieroboam which he did, they departed not from them:

\v 25 And \add so\add* it was at the beginning of their dwelling there, \add that\add* they feared not the \nd LORD\nd*; therefore the \nd LORD\nd* sent Lions among them, which slew \add some\add* of them.

\v 27 Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carie thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence, and let them goe and dwell there, and let him teach them the maner of the God of the land.
\v 28 Then one of the priests whom they had caried away from Samaria, came and dwelt in Bethel, and taught them howe they should feare the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 29 Howbeit, euery nation made gods of their owne, and put \add them\add* in the houses of the high places which the Samaritanes had made, euery nation in their cities wherein they dwelt:
\v 30 And the men of Babylon made Succoth-Benoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima:
\v 31 And the Auites made Nibhaz and Tartak; and the Sepharuites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech, and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharuaim.
\v 32 So they feared the \nd LORD\nd*, and made vnto themselues of the lowest of them priests of the high places, which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places.

\v 36 But the \nd LORD\nd*, who brought you vp out of the land of Egypt, with great power, and a stretched out arme, him shall ye feare, and him shall ye worship, and to him shall ye doe sacrifice.
\v 37 And the Statutes, and the Ordinances, and the Law, and the Commandement which he wrote for you, ye shall obserue to doe for euermore, and ye shall not feare other gods:
