\iex 1 The holinesse, riches, and religious care of Iob for his children. 6 Satan appearing before God, by calumniation obtaineth leaue to tempt Iob. 13. Vnderstanding of the losse of his goods and children, in his mourning hee blesseth God.
\v 1 ¶ There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name \add was\add* Iob, and that man was \f + \fr 1:1 \ft Chap.2.3.\f*perfect and vpright, and one that feared God, and eschewed euill.
\v 2 And there were borne vnto him seuen sonnes, and three daughters.
\v 3 His \f + \fr 1:3 \ft Or, cattell.\f*substance also was seuen thousand sheepe, and three thousand camels, and fiue hundred yoke of oxen, and fiue hundred shee asses, and a very great \f + \fr 1:3 \ft Or, husbandrie.\f*houshold; so that this man was the greatest of all the \f + \fr 1:3 \ft Heb. sonnes of the East.\f*men of the East.
\v 4 And his sonnes went and feasted \add in their\add* houses, euery one his day, and sent and called for their three sisters, to eate and to drinke with them.
\v 5 And it was so, when the dayes of \add their\add* feasting were gone about, that Iob sent and sanctified them, and rose vp early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings \add according\add* to the number of them all: For Iob said, It may be that my sonnes haue sinned, and \f + \fr 1:5 \ft 1.King. 21.10, 13.\f*cursed God in their hearts: Thus did Iob \f + \fr 1:5 \ft Heb. all the dayes.\f*continually.
\v 6 ¶ Now there was a day, when the sons of God came to present themselues before the \nd LORD\nd*, and \f + \fr 1:6 \ft Heb. the aduersarie.\f*Satan came also \f + \fr 1:6 \ft Heb. in the midst of them.\f*among them.
\v 7 And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Satan, Whence commest thou? Then Satan answered the \nd LORD\nd*, and sayde, From going to and fro in the \f + \fr 1:7 \ft 1.Pet.5.8.\f*earth, and from walking vp and downe in it.
\v 8 And the \nd LORD\nd* sayd vnto Satan, \f + \fr 1:8 \ft Heb. hast thou set thy heart on?\f*Hast thou considered my seruant Iob, that there is none like him in the earth? a perfect and an vpright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth euill?
\v 9 Then Satan answered y\sup e\sup* \nd LORD\nd*, and sayd, Doeth Iob feare God for nought?
\v 10 Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on euery side? thou hast blessed the worke of his hands, and his \f + \fr 1:10 \ft Or, cattell.\f*substance is increased in the land.
\v 11 But put foorth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, \f + \fr 1:11 \ft Hebr. if he curse thee not to thy face.\f*and he will curse thee to thy face.
\v 12 And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Satan, Behold, all that hee hath \add is\add* in thy \f + \fr 1:12 \ft Heb. hand.\f*power, onely vpon himselfe put not foorth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 13 ¶ And there was a day, when his sonnes and his daughters \add were\add* eating and drinking wine in their eldest brothers house:
\v 14 And there came a messenger vnto Iob, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them,
\v 15 And the Sabeans fell vpon them, and tooke them away: yea they haue slaine the seruants with the edge of the sword, and I onely am escaped alone, to tell thee.
\v 16 While he \add was\add* yet speaking, there came also another, and said, \f + \fr 1:16 \ft Or, a great fire.\f*The fire of God is fallen from heauen, and hath burnt vp the sheepe, and the seruants, and consumed them, and I onely am escaped alone, to tell thee.
\v 17 While he \add was\add* yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Caldeans made out three bands, and \f + \fr 1:17 \ft Hebr. rushed.\f*fell vpon the camels, and haue caried them away, yea, and slaine the seruants with the edge of the sword, and I onely am escaped alone, to tell thee.
\v 18 While he \add was\add* yet speaking, there came also another, & said, Thy sonnes, and thy daughters, \add were\add* eating and drinking wine in their eldest brothers house.
\v 19 And beholde, there came a great winde \f + \fr 1:19 \ft Heb from a side, &c.\f*from the wildernes, and smote the foure corners of the house, and it fell vpon the yong men, and they are dead, and I onely am escaped alone to tell thee.
\v 20 Then Iob arose, and rent his \f + \fr 1:20 \ft Or, robe.\f*mantle, and shaued his head, and fell downe vpon the ground and worshipped,
\v 21 And said, \f + \fr 1:21 \ft Eccles.5. 14. 1.tim. 6.7.\f*Naked came I out of my mothers wombe, and naked shall I returne thither: the \nd LORD\nd* gaue, and the \nd LORD\nd* hath taken away, blessed be the Name of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 22 In all this Iob sinned not, nor \f + \fr 1:22 \ft Or, attributed folly to God.\f*charged God foolishly.
\c 2
\iex 1 Satan appearing againe before God, obtaineth further leaue to tempt Iob. 7 He smiteth him with sore boiles. 9 Iob reproueth his wife, moouing him to curse God. 11 His three friends condole with him in silence.
\v 1 ¶ Againe there was a day when the sonnes of God came to present themselues before the \nd LORD\nd*, and Satan came also among them to present himselfe before the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 2 And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto \f + \fr 2:2 \ft Chap.1. 7.\f*Satan, From whence commest thou? And Satan answered the \nd LORD\nd*, and said, From going to & fro in the earth, and from walking vp and downe in it.
\v 3 \f + \fr 2:3 \ft Chap.1. ver.1. &8.\f*And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Satan, Hast thou considered my seruant Iob, that \add there is\add* none like him in the earth; a perfect and an vpright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth euill? and still hee holdeth fast his integritie, although thou moouedst mee against him, \f + \fr 2:3 \ft Hebr. to swallow him vp.\f*to destroy him without cause.
\v 4 And Satan answered the \nd LORD\nd*, and said, Skinne for skinne, yea all that a man hath, wil he giue for his life.
\v 5 But put foorth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.
\v 6 And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto Satan, Behold, hee \add is\add* in thine hand, \f + \fr 2:6 \ft Or, onely.\f*but saue his life.
\v 7 ¶ So went Satan foorth from the presence of the \nd LORD\nd*, and smote Iob with sore biles, from the sole of his foote vnto his crowne.
\v 8 And hee tooke him a potsheard to scrape himselfe withall; and hee sate downe among the ashes.
\v 9 ¶ Then saide his wife vnto him, Doest thou still reteine thine integritie? Curse God, and die.
\v 10 But he said vnto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh; what? shall wee receiue good at the hand of God, and shall wee not receiue euill? In all this did not Iob sinne with his lippes.
\v 11 ¶ Now when Iobs three friends heard of all this euill, that was come vpon him, they came euery one from his owne place: Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; for they had made an appointment together to come to mourne with him, and to comfort him.
\v 12 And when they lift vp their eyes afarre off, and knew him not, they lifted vp their voice, and wept; and they rent euery one his mantle, and sprinckled dust vpon their heades toward heauen.
\v 13 So they sate downe with him vpon the ground seuen dayes, and seuen nights, and none spake a word vnto him; for they saw that \add his\add* griefe was very great.
\c 3
\iex 1 Iob curseth the day, and seruices of his birth. 13 The ease of death. 20 He complaineth of life, because of his anguish.
\v 1 ¶ After this, opened Iob his mouth, and cursed his day.
\v 2 And Iob \f + \fr 3:2 \ft Hebr. answered.\f*spake, and said,
\v 3 \f + \fr 3:3 \ft Chap.10. 18, 19. iere. 20.14.\f*Let the day perish, wherein I was borne, and the night \add in which\add* it was said, There is a man-childe conceiued.
\v 4 Let that day bee darkenesse, let not God regard it from aboue, neither let the light shine vpon it.
\v 5 \f + \fr 3:5 \ft Or, challenge it.\f*\f + \fr 3:5 \ft Or, let them terrifie it, as those who haue a bitter day.\f*Let darkenes and the shadowe of death staine it, let a cloud dwell vpon it, let the blacknes of the day terrifie it.
\v 6 \f + \fr 3:6 \ft Or, let it not reioyce among the dayes.\f*As \add for\add* that night, let darkenesse seaze vpon it, let it not be ioyned vnto the dayes of the yeere, let it not come into the number of the moneths.
\v 7 Loe, let that night be solitarie, let no ioyfull voice come therein.
\v 8 \f + \fr 3:8 \ft Or, Leuiathan.\f*Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise vp their mourning.
\v 9 \f + \fr 3:9 \ft Heb. the eye lids of the morning.\f*Let the starres of the twilight thereof be darke, let it looke for light, but \add haue\add* none, neither let it see the dawning of the day:
\v 10 Because it shut not vp the doores of my mothers wombe, nor hid sorrowe from mine eyes.
\v 11 Why died I not from the wombe? \add why\add* did I \add not\add* giue vp the ghost when I came out of the bellie?
\v 12 Why did the knees preuent mee? or why the breasts, that I should sucke?
\v 13 For now should I haue lien still and beene quiet, I should haue slept; then had I bene at rest,
\v 14 With Kings and counsellers of the earth, which built desolate places for themselues,
\v 15 Or with Princes that had golde, who filled their houses with siluer:
\v 16 Or as an hidden vntimely birth, I had not bene; as infants \add which\add* neuer saw light.
\v 17 \f + \fr 3:17 \ft Heb. wearied in strength.\f*There the wicked cease \add from\add* troubling: and there the wearie be at rest.
\v 18 \add There\add* the prisoners rest together, they heare not the voice of the oppressour.
\v 19 The small and great are there, and the seruant \add is\add* free from his master.
\v 20 Wherefore is light giuen to him that is in misery, and life vnto the bitter \add in\add* soule?
\v 21 \f + \fr 3:21 \ft Heb. wait.\f*Which long for death, but it commeth not, and dig for it more then for hid treasures:
\v 22 Which reioice exceedingly, \add and\add* are glad when they can finde the graue?
\v 23 \f + \fr 3:23 \ft Chap.19.8\f*\add Why is light giuen\add* to a man, whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?
\v 24 \f + \fr 3:24 \ft Heb. before my meat.\f*For my sighing commeth before I eate, and my roarings are powred out like the waters.
\v 25 \f + \fr 3:25 \ft Heb. I feared a feare, and it came vpon me.\f*For the thing which I greatly feared is come vpon me, and that which I was afraid of, is come vnto me.
\v 26 I was not in safetie, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet: yet trouble came.

\iex 1 Eliphaz reprooueth Iob for want of religion. 7 He teacheth Gods iudgements to bee not for the righteous, but for the wicked. 12 His fearefull vision, to humble the excellencie of Creatures before God.
\v 1 ¶ Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered, and said,
\v 2 \f + \fr 4:2 \ft Hebr. a word.\f*\f + \fr 4:2 \ft Heb. who can refraine from words?\f*\add If\add* we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieued? But who can withhold himselfe from speaking?
\v 3 Beholde, Thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weake hands.
\v 4 \f + \fr 4:4 \ft Hebr. the bowing knees.\f*Thy words haue vpholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.
\v 5 But now it is come vpon thee, and thou faintest, it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.
\v 6 \add Is\add* not \add this\add* thy feare, thy confidence; the vprightnesse of thy wayes and thy hope?
\v 7 Remember, I pray thee, who \add euer\add* perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?
\v 8 \f + \fr 4:8 \ft Prou.22.8 ose 10.13.\f*Euen as I haue seene, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickednsse, reape the same.
\v 9 \f + \fr 4:9 \ft That is, by his anger, as Esa.30. 33.\f*By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.
\v 10 The roaring of the Lyon, and the voice of the fierce Lyon, and the teeth of the yong Lyons are broken.
\v 11 The old Lyon perisheth for lacke of pray, and the stout Lyons whelpes are scattered abroad.
\v 12 \f + \fr 4:12 \ft Heb. by stealth.\f*Nowe a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine eare receiued a litle thereof.
\v 13 In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deepe sleepe falleth on men:
\v 14 \f + \fr 4:14 \ft Heb. met mee.\f*\f + \fr 4:14 \ft Heb. the multitude of my bones.\f*Feare came vpon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.
\v 15 Then a spirit passed before my face: the haire of my flesh stood vp.
\v 16 \f + \fr 4:16 \ft Or, I heard a still voyce.\f*It stood still, but I could not discerne the forme thereof: an image \add was\add* before mine eyes, \add there was\add* silence, and I heard a voyce, \add saying\add*,
\v 17 Shall mortall man be more iust then God? shall a man bee more pure then his maker?
\v 18 \f + \fr 4:18 \ft Chap. 15. 15. 2.pet. 2.4.\f*\f + \fr 4:18 \ft Or, nor in his Angels, in whom he put light.\f*Behold, hee put no trust in his seruants; and his Angels hee charged with folly:
\v 19 \f + \fr 4:19 \ft 2.Cor.5.1.\f*Howe much lesse on them that dwell \add in\add* houses of clay, whose foundation \add is\add* in the dust, \add which\add* are crushed before the moth.
\v 20 \f + \fr 4:20 \ft Heb. beaten in pieces.\f*They are destroyed from morning to euening: they perish for euer, without any regarding \add it\add*.
\v 21 Doeth not their excellencie \add which is\add* in them, goe away? they die, euen without wisedome.

\iex 1 The harme of inconsideration. 3 The ende of the wicked is misery. 6 God is to be regarded in affliction. 17 The happy ende of Gods correction.

\v 2 \f + \fr 5:2 \ft Or, indignation.\f*For wrath killeth the foolish man, and enuy slayeth the silly one.
\v 3 I haue seene the foolish taking roote: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.
\v 4 His children are farre from safetie, and they are crushed in the gate, neither \add is there\add* any to deliuer \add them\add*.
\v 5 Whose haruest the hungry eateth vp, and taketh it euen out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth vp their substance.
\v 6 \f + \fr 5:6 \ft Or, iniquity.\f*Although affliction commeth not forth of the dust, neither doeth trouble spring out of the ground:

\v 8 I would seeke vnto God, and vnto God would I commit my cause:
\v 9 \f + \fr 5:9 \ft Cha.9.10. psal.72.18. rom.11.33.\f*\f + \fr 5:9 \ft Heb. and there is no search.\f*\f + \fr 5:9 \ft Heb. till there be no number.\f*Which doth great things & vnsearchable: marueilous things without number.
\v 10 \f + \fr 5:10 \ft Heb. outplaces.\f*Who giueth raine vpon the earth, and sendeth waters vpon the fields:
\v 11 \f + \fr 5:11 \ft Psa.113.6. 1.sam.2.7.\f*To set vp on high those that be low; that those which mourne, may be exalted to safetie.
\v 12 \f + \fr 5:12 \ft Neh.4.15. psal. 33.10. isa.8.10.\f*\f + \fr 5:12 \ft Or, cannot performe anything.\f*Hee disappointeth the deuices of the craftie, so that their hands cannot performe \add their\add* enterprise.
\v 13 \f + \fr 5:13 \ft 1.Cor.3. 19.\f*He taketh the wise in their owne craftinesse: and the counsell of the froward is caried headlong.
\v 14 \f + \fr 5:14 \ft Deut.28. 29.\f*\f + \fr 5:14 \ft Or, runne into.\f*They meete with darkenesse in the day time, and grope in the noone day as in the night.
\v 15 But he saueth the poore from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mightie.
\v 16 \f + \fr 5:16 \ft Psal. 107. 42.\f*So the poore hath hope, and iniquitie stoppeth her mouth.
\v 17 \f + \fr 5:17 \ft Pro.3.12. iames 1.12. heb.12.5. apoc.3. 9.\f*Behold, happy \add is\add* the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almightie.
\v 18 \f + \fr 5:18 \ft Deut.32. 39. 1.sam. 2.6. isa.30. 26. hos.6.1.\f*For he maketh sore, and bindeth vp: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.

\iex 1 Iob sheweth that his complaints are not causelesse. 8 Hee wisheth for death, wherein he is assured of comfort. 14 He reprooueth his friends of vnkindnesse.
\v 1 ¶ But Iob answered, and sayd,
\v 2 \f + \fr 6:2 \ft Heb. lifted vp.\f*Oh that my griefe were throughly weighed, and my calamitie layd in the balances together.
\v 3 \f + \fr 6:3 \ft That is, I want words to expresse my griefe.\f*For now it would be heauier then the sand of the sea, therefore my words are swallowed vp.
\v 4 \f + \fr 6:4 \ft Psal. 38.2.\f*For the arrowes of the Almightie \add are\add* within me, the poyson whereof drinketh vp my spirit: the terrors of God doe set themselues in aray against mee.

\v 9 Euen that it would please God to destroy mee, that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off.
\v 10 Then should I yet haue comfort, yea I would harden my selfe in sorrow; let him not spare, for I haue not concealed the words of the holy One.

\v 14 \f + \fr 6:14 \ft Hebr. to him that melteth.\f*To him that is afflicted, pitie \add should be shewed\add* from his friend; But he forsaketh the feare of the Almighty.
\v 15 My brethren haue delt deceitfully as a brooke, & as the streame of brookes they passe away,

\v 18 The pathes of their way are turned aside; they goe to nothing, and perish.
\v 19 The troupes of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.
\v 20 They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.
\v 21 \f + \fr 6:21 \ft Or, for now ye are like to them. Hebr. to it.\f*\f + \fr 6:21 \ft Hebr. Not.\f*For now ye are nothing; ye see \add my\add* casting downe, and are afraid.

\v 23 Or deliuer me from the enemies hand, or redeeme me from the hand of the mighty?
\v 24 Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause mee to vnderstand wherein I haue erred.
\v 25 How forcible are right wordes? but what doeth your arguing reproue?

\v 4 \f + \fr 7:4 \ft Hebr. the euening be measured.\f*When I lie downe, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro, vnto the dawning of the day.
\v 5 My flesh is cloathed with wormes and clods of dust, my skinne is broken, and become loathsome.

\v 7 \f + \fr 7:7 \ft Hebr. shall not returne.\f*\f + \fr 7:7 \ft To see, that is, to enioy.\f*O remember that my life \add is\add* winde: mine eye shall no more see good.
\v 8 \f + \fr 7:8 \ft That is, I can liue no longer.\f*The eye of him that hath seene me, shall see mee no \add more\add*: thine eyes \add are\add* vpon me, and I \add am\add* not.
\v 9 \add As\add* the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth downe to the graue, shall come vp no \add more\add*.
\v 10 Hee shall returne no more to his house: neither shall his place know him any more.
\v 11 Therefore I will not refraine my mouth, I wil speake in the anguish of my spirit, I will complaine in the bitternesse of my soule.
\v 12 \add Am\add* I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch ouer me?
\v 13 When I say, My bed shal comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint:

\v 8 \f + \fr 42:8 \ft Heb. his face or person.\f*Therefore take vnto you now seuen bullocks, and seuen rammes, and goe to my seruant Iob, and offer vp for your selues a burnt offring, and my seruant Iob shal pray for you, for him wil I accept: lest I deale with you \add after your\add* folly, in that ye haue not spoken of mee \add the thing which is\add* right, like my seruant Iob.
\v 9 \f + \fr 42:9 \ft Heb. the face of Iob.\f*So Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, \add and\add* Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the \nd LORD\nd* commanded them: the \nd LORD\nd* also accepted Iob.
\v 10 \f + \fr 42:10 \ft Heb. added to Iob vnto the double.\f*And the \nd LORD\nd* turned the captiuitie of Iob, when he prayed for his friends: also the \nd LORD\nd* gaue Iob twice as much as he had before.
\v 11 Then came there vnto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had bin of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoned him, and comforted him ouer all the euill that the \nd LORD\nd* had brought vpon him: euery man also gaue him a piece of money, and euery one an eare-ring of gold.
\v 12 So the \nd LORD\nd* blessed the latter end of Iob, more then his beginning: for he had fourteene thousand sheepe, and sixe thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand shee asses.
\v 13 He had also seuen sonnes, and three daughters.
\v 14 And he called the name of the first, Iemima, and the name of the second, Kezia, and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.
\v 15 And in all the land were no women found \add so\add* faire as the daughters of Iob: and their father gaue them inheritance among their brethren.
\v 16 After this liued Iob an hundred and fourtie yeeres, and saw his sonnes, and his sonnes sonnes, \add euen\add* foure generations.
\v 17 So Iob died \add being\add* old, and full of dayes.
