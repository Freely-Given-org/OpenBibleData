\v 0 1 The time, 3 and the calling of Ieremiah: 11 His propheticall visions of an Almond rod, and a seething pot: 15 His heauy message against Iudah. 17 God incourageth him with his promise of assistance.
\v 1 ¶ The wordes of Ieremiah the sonne of Hilkiah, of the Priests that \add were\add* in Anathoth in the land of Beniamin:
\v 2 To whom the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came in the dayes of Iosiah the sonne of Amon king of Iudah, in the thirteenth yeere of his reigne.
\v 3 It came also in the dayes of Iehoiakim the sonne of Iosiah king of Iudah, vnto the ende of the eleuenth yeere of Zedekiah the sonne of Iosiah king of Iudah, vnto the carrying away of Ierusalem captiue in the fift moneth.
\v 4 Then the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came vnto me, saying,
\v 5 Before I \f + \fr 1:5 \ft Isa.49. 1,5.\f*formed thee in the bellie, I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the wombe, I \f + \fr 1:5 \ft Gal. 5.1, 15.\f*sanctified thee, \add and\add* I \f + \fr 1:5 \ft Hebr. gaue.\f*ordeined thee a Prophet vnto the nations.
\v 6 Then said I, Ah \f + \fr 1:6 \ft Exo.3.4.\f*\nd LORD\nd* God, behold, I cannot speake, for I \add am\add* a childe.
\v 7 ¶ But the \nd LORD\nd* sayd vnto me, Say not, I \add am\add* a childe: for thou shalt goe to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoeuer I command thee, thou shalt speake.
\v 8 \f + \fr 1:8 \ft Eze.3.9.\f*Be not afraid of their faces: for \f + \fr 1:8 \ft Exo.3.12. deu.31.6,8. iosh.1.5. heb.13.6.\f*I \add am\add* with thee to deliuer thee, sayth the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 9 Then the \nd LORD\nd* put foorth his hand, and \f + \fr 1:9 \ft Isai.6.7.\f*touched my mouth, and the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto me, Behold, I haue \f + \fr 1:9 \ft Cha.5.14.\f*put my words in thy mouth.
\v 10 See, I haue this day set thee ouer the nations, and ouer the kingdomes, to \f + \fr 1:10 \ft Cha.18.7. 2.cor.10.4,5.\f*roote out, and to pull downe, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build and to plant.
\v 11 ¶ Moreouer, the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came vnto me, saying; Ieremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rodde of an almond tree.
\v 12 Then said the \nd LORD\nd* vnto me, Thou hast well seene: for I will hasten my word to performe it.
\v 13 And the worde of the \nd LORD\nd* came vnto mee the second time, saying; What seest thou? And I said; I see a seething pot, and the face thereof was \f + \fr 1:13 \ft Heb. from the face of the North.\f*towards the North.
\v 14 Then the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto me; Out of the \f + \fr 1:14 \ft Chap. 4.6.\f*North an euill \f + \fr 1:14 \ft Heb. shall be opened.\f*shal breake foorth vpon all the inhabitants of the land.
\v 15 For loe, I will \f + \fr 1:15 \ft Cha.5.15. and 6.22. and 10.22.\f*call all the families of the kingdoms of the North, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, and they shall come, and they shall set euery one his throne at the entring of the gates of Ierusalem, and against all the walles thereof round about, & against all the cities of Iudah.
\v 16 And I will vtter my iudgements against them touching all their wickednesse, who haue forsaken me, and haue burnt incense vnto other gods, and worshipped the workes of their owne hands.
\v 17 ¶ Thou therefore gird vp thy loynes, and arise and speake vnto them all that I commaund thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I \f + \fr 1:17 \ft Or, breake to pieces.\f*confound thee before them.
\v 18 For behold, I haue made thee this day \f + \fr 1:18 \ft Cha.6.27. and 15.20. isai. 50.7.\f*a defenced citie, and an yron pillar, and brasen walles against the whole land, against the kings of Iudah, against the princes thereof, against the Priests thereof, and against the people of the land.
\v 19 And they shall fight against thee, but they shall not preuaile against thee: for I \add am\add* with thee, sayth the \nd LORD\nd*, to deliuer thee.

\v 0 1 God hauing shewed his former kindnesse, expostulateth with the Iewes, their causelesse reuolt, 9 beyond any example. 14 They are the causes of their owne calamities. 20 The sinnes of Iudah. 31 Her confidence is reiected.
\v 1 ¶ Moreouer, the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came to me, saying;
\v 2 Goe, and crie in the eares of Ierusalem, saying; Thus sayth the \nd LORD\nd*, I remember \f + \fr 2:2 \ft Or, for thy sake.\f*thee, the kindnesse of thy \f + \fr 2:2 \ft Eze.16.8. cha. 12. 14.\f*youth, the loue of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wildernesse, in a land \add that was\add* not sowen.
\v 3 Israel \add was\add* holinesse vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, \add and\add* the first fruites of his increase: all that deuoure him, shall offend, euill shall come vpon them, sayth the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 4 Heare ye the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, O house of Iacob, and all the families of the house of Israel.
\v 5 ¶ Thus sayth the \nd LORD\nd*, What iniquitie haue your fathers found in me, that they are gone farre from mee, and haue walked after vanitie, and are become vaine?
\v 6 Neither sayd they, Where \add is\add* the \nd LORD\nd* that \f + \fr 2:6 \ft Isai.63.9, 11,13. ose. 13.4.\f*brought vs vp out of the land of Egypt? that led vs through the wildernesse, through a land of deserts and of pittes, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed thorow, and where no man dwelt.
\v 7 And I brought you into a plentifull countrey, to eate the fruit thereof, and the goodnesse thereof; but when ye entred yee \f + \fr 2:7 \ft Psal.78. 58. and 106.38.\f*defiled my land, and made mine heritage an abomination.
\v 8 The Priests said not, Where \add is\add* the \nd LORD\nd*? and they that handle the \f + \fr 2:8 \ft Rom.2.20\f*Law knew me not: the pastours also transgressed against mee, and the Prophets prophecied by Baal, and walked after \add things that\add* doe not profit.
\v 9 ¶ Wherefore, I will yet pleade with you, sayth the \nd LORD\nd*, and with your childrens children will I pleade.
\v 10 For passe \f + \fr 2:10 \ft Or, ouer to.\f*ouer the yles of Chittim, and see; and send vnto Kedar and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.
\v 11 \f + \fr 2:11 \ft Cha. 16.20\f*Hath a nation changed \add their\add* Gods, which \add are\add* yet no Gods? but my people haue changed their glory, for \add that which\add* doth not profit.
\v 12 Be astonished, O yee heauens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be yee very desolate, saith the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 13 \f + \fr 2:13 \ft Chap. 17. 13. & 18.14 psal.36.9.\f*For my people haue committed two euils: they haue forsaken me, the fountaine of liuing waters, \add and\add* hewed them out cisternes, broken cisternes that can hold no water.
\v 14 ¶ \f + \fr 2:14 \ft Heb. become a spoile.\f*\add Is\add* Israel a seruant? is he a home-borne \add slaue\add*? why is he spoiled?
\v 15 \f + \fr 2:15 \ft Heb. gaue out their voyce.\f*The young lyons roared vpon him \add and\add* yelled, and they made his land waste: his cities are burnt without inhabitant.
\v 16 \f + \fr 2:16 \ft Or, feede on thy crown, deut. 33.12 Isai. 8.8.\f*Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes haue broken the crowne of thy head.
\v 17 Hast thou not procured this vnto thy selfe, in that thou hast forsaken the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, when he led thee by the way?
\v 18 And now what hast thou to doe in the way of Egypt, to drinke the waters of Sihor? Or what hast thou to doe in the way of Assyria, to drinke the waters of the riuer?
\v 19 \f + \fr 2:19 \ft Isai.3.9. os.5.5.\f*Thine owne wickednesse shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reproue thee: know therefore and see, that \add it is\add* an euill \add thing\add* and bitter that thou hast forsaken the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, and that my feare \add is\add* not in thee, saith the \nd LORD\nd* GOD of Hostes.
\v 20 ¶ \f + \fr 2:20 \ft Or, serue.\f*\f + \fr 2:20 \ft Isai. 57.5,7.\f*\f + \fr 2:20 \ft Ier.3.6.\f*For of old time I haue broken thy yoke, \add and\add* burst thy bands, and thou saidst; I will not transgresse: when vpon euery high hill, and vnder euery greene tree thou wandrest, playing the harlot.
\v 21 \f + \fr 2:21 \ft Matth.21.23. mar.12.1. luc.20.9.\f*\f + \fr 2:21 \ft Exod.15.17. psal.44.3. and 80.9. Isai.5.2.\f*Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholy a right seede: How then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine vnto me?
\v 22 \f + \fr 2:22 \ft Iob. 9.30.\f*For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much sope, \add yet\add* thine iniquitie is marked before me, saith the \nd LORD\nd* GOD.
\v 23 \f + \fr 2:23 \ft Or, O swift dromedarie.\f*How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I haue not gone after Baalim? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: \add thou art\add* a swift dromedarie trauersing her wayes.
\v 24 \f + \fr 2:24 \ft Or, O wild asse &c.\f*\f + \fr 2:24 \ft Heb. taught\f*\f + \fr 2:24 \ft Heb. the desire of her heart.\f*\f + \fr 2:24 \ft Or, reuerse it.\f*A wild asse vsed to the wildernesse, \add that\add* snuffeth vp the wind at her pleasure, in her occasion who can turne her away? all they that seeke her will not wearie themselues, in her moneth they shall find her.
\v 25 \f + \fr 2:25 \ft Or, is the case desperate?\f*Withhold thy foote from being vnshod, and thy throte from thirst: but thou saidst, There is no hope. No, for I haue loued strangers, and after them will I goe.
\v 26 As the thiefe is ashamed, when he is found: so is the house of Israel ashamed, they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, & their prophets,
\v 27 \f + \fr 2:27 \ft Or, begotten me.\f*\f + \fr 2:27 \ft Heb. the hinder part part of the necke.\f*\f + \fr 2:27 \ft Isai. 26. 16.\f*Saying to a stocke; Thou \add art\add* my father, and to a stone; Thou hast brought me forth: for they haue turned \add their\add* backe vnto me, and not \add their\add* face: but in the time of their trouble, they will say; Arise and saue vs.

\v 29 Wherefore will yee plead with me? yee all haue transgressed against me, saith the \nd LORD\nd*.

\v 32 Can a maide forget her ornaments, \add or\add* a bride her attire? yet my people haue forgotten me dayes without number.
\v 33 Why trimmest thou thy way to seeke loue? therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy wayes.

\v 0 1 Gods great mercy in Iudahs vile whoredome. 6 Iudah is worse then Israel. 12 The promises of the Gospel, to the penitent. 20 Israel reprooued and called by God, maketh a solemne confession of their sinnes.
\v 1 ¶ \f + \fr 3:1 \ft Heb. saying.\f*\f + \fr 3:1 \ft Deu.24.4\f*They say; If a man put away his wife, and she goe from him, and become another mans, shall hee returne vnto her againe? shall not that land be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many louers; yet returne againe to me, saith the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 2 Lift vp thine eyes vnto the high places, and see where thou hast not bene lien with: in the wayes hast thou sate for them, as the Arabian in the wildernesse, and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredomes, and with thy wickednes.
\v 3 \f + \fr 3:3 \ft Deut.28.24. chap.9. 12.\f*\f + \fr 3:3 \ft Cha.6.15.\f*Therefore the showres haue bin withholden, and there hath bene no latter raine, and thou haddest a whores forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed.
\v 4 Wilt thou not from this time cry vnto me; My father, thou \add art\add* the guide of my youth?
\v 5 Will he reserue \add his anger\add* for euer? wil he keepe \add it\add* to the end? Behold, thou hast spoken and done euill things as thou couldest.
\v 6 ¶ \f + \fr 3:6 \ft Cha.2.20.\f*The \nd LORD\nd* said also vnto me, in the daies of Iosiah the king, Hast thou seene \add that\add* which backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone vp vpon euery high mountaine, and vnder euery greene tree, and there hath plaied the harlot.
\v 7 And I said after she had done all these \add things\add*; Turne thou vnto me: but shee returned not, and her treacherous sister Iudah saw \add it\add*.
\v 8 And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adulterie, I had put her away and giuen her a bill of diuorce: yet her treacherous sister Iudah feared not, but went and played the harlot also.
\v 9 \f + \fr 3:9 \ft Or, fame.\f*And it came to passe thorow the lightnes of her whoredome, that shee defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stockes.
\v 10 \f + \fr 3:10 \ft Hebr. in falshood.\f*And yet for all this her treacherous sister Iudah hath not turned vnto mee with her whole heart, but fainedly, saith the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 11 And the \nd LORD\nd* said vnto mee, The backesliding Israel hath iustified her selfe more then treacherous Iudah.

\v 13 Only acknowledge thine iniquity that thou hast transgressed against the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, and hast scattered thy wayes to the strangers vnder euery greene tree, and ye haue not obeyed my voice, saith the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 14 Turne, O backesliding children, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, for I am maried vnto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I wil bring you to Zion.
\v 15 \f + \fr 3:15 \ft Cha.23.4.\f*And I will giue you Pastours according to mine heart, which shall feede you with knowledge and vnderstanding.

\v 20 ¶ \f + \fr 3:20 \ft Heb. friend\f*Surely \add as\add* a wife treacherously departeth from her husband: so haue you dealt treacherously with mee, O house of Israel, saith the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 21 A voice was heard vpon the high places, weeping \add and\add* supplications of the children of Israel: for they haue peruerted their way, \add and\add* they haue forgotten the \nd LORD\nd* their God.
\v 22 \f + \fr 3:22 \ft Ose. 14.2.\f*Returne ye backsliding children, \add and\add* I wil heale your backslidings: Beholde, wee come vnto thee, for thou \add art\add* the \nd LORD\nd* our God.
\v 23 Truely in vaine \add is saluation hoped for\add* from the hilles, \add and from\add* the multitude of mountaines: truely in the \nd LORD\nd* our God \add is\add* the saluation of Israel.

\v 25 We lie downe in our shame, and our confusion couereth vs: for we haue sinned against the \nd LORD\nd* our God, wee and our fathers from our youth euen vnto this day, and haue not obeied the voice of the \nd LORD\nd* our God.

\v 0 1 God calleth Israel by his promise. 3 He exhorteth Iudah to repentance by fearefull iudgements. 19 A grieuous lamentation for the miseries of Iudah.
\v 1 ¶ \f + \fr 4:1 \ft Ioel 2. 12.\f*If thou wilt returne, O Israel, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, returne vnto mee: and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight, then shalt thou not remoue.

\v 3 ¶ For thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* to the men of Iudah and Ierusalem, Breake vp your fallow ground, and sow not among thornes.
\v 4 Circumcise your selues to the \nd LORD\nd*, and take away the foreskinnes of your heart, ye men of Iudah, and inhabitants of Ierusalem, lest my furie come forth like fire, and burne that none can quench \add it\add*, because of the euill of your doings.

\v 10 Then said I, Ah \nd LORD\nd* God, surely thou hast greatly deceiued this people, and Ierusalem, saying, Ye shall haue peace, whereas the sword reacheth vnto the soule.
\v 11 At that time shall it bee said to this people, and to Ierusalem; A dry winde of the high places in the wildernes toward the daughter of my people, not to fanne, nor to cleanse.

\v 1 ¶ In the beginning of the reigne of Iehoiakim the sonne of Iosiah King of Iudah, came this worde vnto Ieremiah from the \nd LORD\nd*, saying,
\v 2 Thus sayth the \nd LORD\nd* to me, Make thee bonds and yokes, and put them vpon thy necke.
\v 3 And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Ierusalem vnto Zedekiah king of Iudah.

\v 7 And all nations shall serue him and his sonne, and his sonnes sonne, vntill the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great kings shall serue themselues of him.
\v 8 And it shall come to passe, \add that\add* the nation and kingdome which will not serue the same Nebuchad-nezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put their necke vnder the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, sayth the \nd LORD\nd*, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, vntill I haue consumed them by his hand.

\v 11 But the nations that bring their necke vnder the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serue him, those will I let remaine still in their owne land, sayth the \nd LORD\nd*, and they shall till it, and dwell therein.
\v 12 ¶ I spake also to Zedekiah king of Iudah according to all these wordes, saying, Bring your neckes vnder the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serue him and his people, and liue.
\v 13 Why will yee die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the \nd LORD\nd* hath spoken against the nation that will not serue the king of Babylon?

\v 16 Also I spake to the priests, and to all this people, saying; Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Hearken not to the words of your prophets, that prophecie vnto you, saying; Behold, the vessels of the \nd LORD\nd*s house shall now shortly be brought againe from Babylon; for they prophecie a lie vnto you.
\v 17 Hearken not vnto them: serue the king of Babylon, and liue: wherefore should this citie be laid waste?

\c 28
\v 0 1 Hananiah prophecieth falsely the returne of the vessels and of Ieconiah. 5 Ieremiah wishing it to be true, sheweth that the euent will declare who are true Prophets. 10 Hananiah breaketh Ieremiahs yoke. 12 Ieremiah telleth of an yron yoke, 15 and foretelleth Hananiahs death.
\v 1 ¶ And it came to passe the same yeere, in the beginning of the reigne of Zedekiah king of Iudah, in the fourth yeere, \add and\add* in the fift moneth, \add that\add* Hananiah the sonne of Azur the prophet, which \add was\add* of Gibeon, spake vnto mee in the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying;

\v 5 ¶ Then the prophet Ieremiah said vnto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people, that stood in the house of the \nd LORD\nd*,
\v 6 Euen the prophet Ieremiah said; Amen: the \nd LORD\nd* doe so, the \nd LORD\nd* performe the words which thou hast prophecied, to bring againe the vessels of the \nd LORD\nd*s house, and all that is caried away captiue from Babylon into this place.
\v 7 Neuerthelesse, heare thou now this word that I speake in thine eares, and in the eares of all the people.
\v 8 The prophets that haue beene before mee, and before thee of old, prophecied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of warre, and of euill, and of pestilence.
\v 9 The prophet which prophecieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to passe, \add then\add* shall the prophet be knowen, that the \nd LORD\nd* hath truely sent him.
\v 10 ¶ \f + \fr 28:10 \ft Chap.27. 2.\f*Then Hananiah the prophet tooke the yoke from off the prophet Ieremiahs necke, and brake it.
\v 11 And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying; Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Euen so will I breake the yoke of Nebuchadnezzer king of Babylon from the necke of all nations within the space of two full yeeres: and the Prophet Ieremiah went his way.
\v 12 ¶ Then the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came vnto Ieremiah the Prophet (after that Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the necke of the Prophet Ieremiah) saying,
\v 13 Goe, and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Thou hast broken the yokes of wood, but thou shalt make for them yokes of yron.
\v 14 For thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel, I haue put a yoke of yron vpon the neck of all these nations, that they may serue Nebuchad-nezzar king of Babylon, and they shall serue him, and I haue giuen him the beasts of the field also.
\v 15 ¶ Then said the Prophet Ieremiah vnto Hananiah the prophet, Heare nowe Hananiah: the \nd LORD\nd* hath not sent thee, but thou makest this people to trust in a lye.
\v 16 \f + \fr 28:16 \ft Deut.13. 5. chap.29. 32.\f*\f + \fr 28:16 \ft Heb. reuolt.\f*Therefore thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Beholde, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth: this yeere thou shalt die, because thou hast taught rebellion against the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 17 So Hananiah the prophet died the same yeere, in the seuenth moneth.

\v 0 1 Ieremiah sendeth a letter to the captiues in Babylon, to be quiet there, 8 and not to beleeue the dreames of their prophets, 10 and that they shall returne with grace, after seuentie yeeres. 15 He foretelleth the destruction of the rest for their disobedience. 20 He sheweth the fearefull end of Ahab and Zedekiah, two lying prophets. 24 Shemaiah writeth a letter against Ieremiah. 30 Ieremiah readeth his doome.
\v 1 ¶ Now these \add are\add* the words of the letter, that Ieremiah the prophet sent from Ierusalem vnto the residue of the elders which were caried away captiues, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchad-nezzar had caried away captiue from Ierusalem to Babylon,

\v 3 By the hand of Elasah the sonne of Shaphan, and Gemariah the sonne of Hilkiah, whome Zedekiah king of Iudah sent vnto Babylon to Nebuchad-nezzar king of Babylon, saying,
\v 4 Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts the God of Israel vnto all that are caried away captiues, whom I haue caused to be caried away from Ierusalem vnto Babylon:
\v 5 Build ye houses and dwell \add in them\add*, and plant gardens, and eate the fruit of them.
\v 6 Take ye wiues, and beget sonnes and daughters, and take wiues for your sonnes, and giue your daughters to husbands, that they may beare sonnes and daughters, that ye may bee increased there, and not diminished.
\v 7 And seeke the peace of the citie, whither I haue caused you to be caried away captiues, & pray vnto the \nd LORD\nd* for it: for in the peace thereof shall yee haue peace.
\v 8 ¶ \f + \fr 29:8 \ft Chap.14. 14. and 23. 21. and 27. 15.\f*For thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel, Let not your prophets and your diuiners, that bee in the midst of you, deceiue you, neither hearken to your dreames which yee cause to \add be\add* dreamed.

\v 13 And ye shall seeke me, and finde \add me\add*, when ye shall search for me with all your heart.
\v 14 And I will be found of you, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, and I will turne away your captiuitie, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whither I haue driuen you, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, and I will bring you againe into the place whence I caused you to be caried away captiue.

\v 20 ¶ Heare yee therefore the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, all ye of the captiuitie, whom I haue sent from Ierusalem to Babylon.

\v 0 1 Ieremiah being imprisoned by Zedekiah for his prophecie, 6 buyeth Hanameels field. 13 Baruch must preserue the euidences, as tokens of the peoples returne. 16 Ieremiah in his prayer complaineth to God. 26 God confirmeth the captiuitie for their sinnes, 36 and promiseth a gracious returne.
\v 1 ¶ The worde that came to Ieremiah from the \nd LORD\nd* in the tenth yeere of Zedekiah king of Iudah, which \add was\add* the eighteenth yeere of Nebuchad-rezzar.
\v 2 For then the king of Babylons armie besieged Ierusalem: and Ieremiah the prophet was shut vp in the court of the prison which \add was\add* in the king of Iudahs house.
\v 3 \f + \fr 32:3 \ft Cha. 34.2\f*For Zedekiah king of Iudah had shut him vp, saying, Wherefore doest thou prophecie and say, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Behold, I will giue this citie into the hand of the king of Babylon, and hee shall take it?
\v 4 \f + \fr 32:4 \ft Chap.34.3.\f*And Zedekiah king of Iudah, shal not escape out of the hand of the Caldeans, but shall surely be deliuered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shal speake with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes.
\v 5 And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be vntill I visit him, saith the \nd LORD\nd*: though ye fight with the Caldeans, yee shall not prosper.
\v 6 ¶ And Ieremiah said; The word of the \nd LORD\nd* came vnto me, saying;
\v 7 \f + \fr 32:7 \ft Leuit. 25. 24. ruth.4. 4.\f*Behold, Hanameel the sonne of Shallum thine vncle, shall come vnto thee, saying; Buy thee my field that \add is\add* in Anathoth: for the right of redemption \add is\add* thine to buy \add it\add*.
\v 8 So Hanameel mine vncles sonne came to me in the court of the prison, according to the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, and said vnto me; Buy my field, I pray thee, that \add is\add* in Anathoth, which \add is\add* in the countrey of Beniamin: for the right of inheritance \add is\add* thine, and the redemption \add is\add* thine, buy \add it\add* for thy selfe.

\v 9 \f + \fr 32:9 \ft Or, seuen shekels and ten pieces of siluer.\f*And I bought the field of Hanameel my vncles sonne, that \add was\add* in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, \add euen\add* seuenteene shekels of siluer.
\v 10 \f + \fr 32:10 \ft Heb. wrote in the booke.\f*And I subscribed the euidence, and sealed \add it\add*, and tooke witnesses, and weighed \add him\add* the money in the ballances.
\v 11 So I tooke the euidence of the purchase, \add both\add* that which was sealed \add according\add* to the law and custome, and that which was open.
\v 12 And I gaue the euidence of the purchase vnto Baruch the sonne of Neriah, the sonne of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine vncles sonne, and in the presence of the witnesses, that subscribed the booke of the purchase, before all the Iewes that sate in the court of the prison.
\v 13 ¶ And I charged Baruch before them, saying,
\v 14 Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts the God of Israel; Take these euidences, this euidence of the purchase, both which is sealed, and this euidence which is open, and put them in an earthen vessell, that they may continue many daies.
\v 15 For thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hostes the God of Israel; Houses and fields, and Uineyards shalbe possessed againe in this land.
\v 16 ¶ Now when I had deliuered the euidence of the purchase vnto Baruch the sonne of Neriah, I prayed vnto the \nd LORD\nd*, saying,

\v 22 And hast giuen them this land which thou didst sweare to their fathers to giue them a land flowing with milke and honie.
\v 23 And they came in and possessed it, but they obeied not thy voice, neither walked in thy Law, they haue done nothing of all that thou commaundedst them to doe: therefore thou hast caused all this euill to come vpon them.

\v 25 And thou hast said vnto mee, O \nd LORD\nd* God, buy thee the field for money, and take witnesses: for the citie is giuen into the hand of the Caldeans.

\v 36 ¶ And now therefore, thus sayth the \nd LORD\nd* the God of Israel concerning this citie, whereof ye say, It shall be deliuered into the hand of the king of Babylon, by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence:

\v 0 1 Ieremiah prophecieth the captiuitie of Zedekiah, and the Citie. 8 The Princes and the people hauing dismissed their bondseruants, contrary to the Couenant of God, reassume them. 12 Ieremiah for their disobedience, giueth them and Zedekiah, into the hands of their enemies.

\v 0 1 By the obedience of the Rechabites, 12 Ieremiah condemneth the disobedience of the Iewes. 18 God blesseth the Rechabites for their obedience.
\v 1 ¶ The word which came vnto Ieremiah from the \nd LORD\nd*, in the daies of Iehoiakim the sonne of Iosiah King of Iudah, saying,
\v 2 Goe vnto the house of the Rechabites, and speake vnto them, and bring them into the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, into one of the chambers, and giue them wine to drinke.
\v 3 Then I tooke Iaazaniah the sonne of Ieremiah the sonne of Habazimah and his brethren, and all his sonnes, and the whole house of the Rechabites.
\v 4 \f + \fr 35:4 \ft Hebr. threshold or vessell.\f*And I brought them into the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, into the chamber of the sonnes of Hanan, the sonne of Igdaliah a man of God, which \add was\add* by the chamber of the Princes, which \add was\add* aboue the chamber of Maaseiah, the sonne of Shallum, the keeper of the doore.
\v 5 And I set before the sonnes of the house of the Rechabites, pottes, full of wine, and cups, and I said vnto them, Drinke ye wine.
\v 6 But they said, We will drinke no wine: for Ionadab the sonne of Rechab our father, commanded vs, saying; Ye shall drinke no wine, \add neither ye\add*, nor your sonnes for euer.
\v 7 Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant Uineyard, nor haue \add any\add*: but all your dayes ye shall dwell in tents, that ye may liue many dayes in the land where ye \add be\add* strangers.
\v 8 Thus haue we obeyed the voice of Ionadab the sonne of Rechab our father, in all that he hath charged vs, to drinke no wine all our dayes, we, our wiues, our sonnes, nor our daughters:
\v 9 Nor to build houses for vs to dwel in, neither haue we Uineyard, nor field, nor seed.
\v 10 But wee haue dwelt in tents, and haue obeyed, and done according to all that Ionadab our father commanded vs.
\v 11 But it came to passe when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came vp into the land, that we said, Come, and let vs goe to Ierusalem for feare of the armie of the Caldeans, and for feare of the armie of the Syrians: so we dwell at Ierusalem.
\v 12 ¶ Then came the word of the \nd LORD\nd* vnto Ieremiah, saying,
\v 13 Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel, Goe and tel the men of Iudah, and inhabitants of Ierusalem, Will yee not receiue instruction to hearken to my words, saith the \nd LORD\nd*?
\v 14 The wordes of Ionadab the sonne of Rechab, that hee commanded his sonnes, not to drinke wine, are performed; for vnto this day they drinke none, but obey their fathers commandement: notwithstanding I haue spoken vnto you, rising early, and speaking, but ye hearkened not vnto me.
\v 15 \f + \fr 35:15 \ft Chap. 18. 11. and 25. 5.\f*I haue sent also vnto you all my seruants the Prophets, rising vp early and sending \add them\add*, saying, Returne ye now euery man from his euil way, and amend your doings, and goe not after other gods to serue them, and ye shall dwell in the land, which I haue giuen to you, and to your fathers: but yee haue not enclined your eare, nor hearkned vnto me.
\v 16 Because the sonnes of Ionadab, the sonne of Rechab, haue performed the commaundement of their father, which he commaunded them, but this people hath not hearkened vnto me;
\v 17 Therefore thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* God of hostes, the God of Israel, Behold, I will bring vpon Iudah, and vpon all the inhabitants of Ierusalem, all the euill that I haue pronounced against them: because I haue spoken vnto them, but they haue not heard, and I haue called vnto them, but they haue not answered.
\v 18 ¶ And Ieremiah sayd vnto the house of the Rechabites, Thus sayth the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts the God of Israel, Because ye haue obeyed the commandement of Ionadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according vnto all that he hath commanded you:
\v 19 \f + \fr 35:19 \ft Heb. there shall not a man be cut off from, &c.\f*Therefore thus sayth the \nd LORD\nd* of hostes, the God of Israel, Ionadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for euer.

\v 0 1 Ieremiah causeth Baruch to write his prophecie, 5 and publikely ro reade it. 11 The Princes hauing intelligence thereof by Michaiah, send Iehudi to fetch the roule and reade it. 19 They will Baruch to hide himselfe and Ieremiah. 20 The king Iehoiakim being certified thereof, heareth part of it, and burneth the roule. 27 Ieremiah denounceth his iudgement. 32 Baruch writeth a newe copie.
\v 1 ¶ And it came to passe in the fourth yeere of Iehoiakim the sonne of Iosiah king of Iudah, \add that\add* this word came vnto Ieremiah from the \nd LORD\nd*, saying;
\v 2 \f + \fr 36:2 \ft Cha.25.3\f*Take thee a roule of a booke, and write therein all the words that I haue spoken vnto thee against Israel, and against Iudah, & against all the nations, from the day I spake vnto thee, frō the dayes of Iosiah, euen vnto this day.
\v 3 It may be that the house of Iudah will heare all the euil which I purpose to doe vnto them; that they may returne euery man from his euill way, that I may forgiue their iniquitie, and their sinne.
\v 4 Then Ieremiah called Baruch the sonne of Neriah, and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Ieremiah all the words of the \nd LORD\nd*, which he had spoken vnto him, vpon a roule of a booke.
\v 5 And Ieremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I \add am\add* shut vp, I cannot goe into the house of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 6 Therefore goe thou and reade in the roule, which thou hast written from my mouth, the wordes of the \nd LORD\nd* in the eares of the people in the \nd LORD\nd*s house vpon the fasting day: and also thou shalt reade them in the eares of all Iudah, that come out of their cities.
\v 7 \f + \fr 36:7 \ft Heb. their supplication shall fall.\f*It may bee they will present their supplication before the \nd LORD\nd*, and will returne euery one from his euill way; for great \add is\add* the anger and the furie that the \nd LORD\nd* hath pronounced against this people.
\v 8 And Baruch the sonne of Neriah did according to all that Ieremiah the Prophet commanded him, reading in the booke the wordes of the \nd LORD\nd*, in the \nd LORD\nd*s house.
\v 9 And it came to passe in the fifth yeere of Iehoiakim the sonne of Iosiah king of Iudah, in the ninth moneth, \add that\add* they proclaimed a fast before the \nd LORD\nd* to all the people in Ierusalem, & to all the people that came from the cities of Iudah vnto Ierusalem.
\v 10 \f + \fr 36:10 \ft Or, doore.\f*\f + \fr 36:10 \ft Chap. 26. 10.\f*Then read Baruch in the booke, the wordes of Ieremiah in the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, in the chamber of Gemariah the sonne of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court at the entry of the newe gate of the \nd LORD\nd*s house, in the eares of all the people.
\v 11 ¶ When Michaiah the sonne of Gemariah the sonne of Shaphan had heard out of the booke, all the words of the \nd LORD\nd*;
\v 12 Then hee went downe into the kings house into the scribes chamber, and loe, all the princes sate there, \add euen\add* Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the sonne of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the sonne of Achbor, and Gemariah the sonne of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the sonne of Hananiah, and all the princes.
\v 13 Then Michaiah declared vnto them all the words that hee had heard when Baruch read the booke in the eares of the people.
\v 14 Therefore all the princes sent Iehudi the sonne of Nethaniah, the sonne of Shelemiah, the sonne of Cushi, vnto Baruch, saying; Take in thine hand the roule wherein thou hast read in the eares of the people, and come. So Baruch the sonne of Neriah took the roule in his hand, and came vnto them.
\v 15 And they sayde vnto him, Sit downe now and read it in our eares. So Baruch read \add it\add* in their eares.
\v 16 Now it came to passe when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and sayd vnto Baruch, Wee will surely tell the King of all these words.
\v 17 And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell vs now, How diddest thou write all these words at his mouth?
\v 18 Then Baruch answered them, Hee pronounced all these words vnto me with his mouth, and I wrote \add them\add* with inke in the Booke.
\v 19 Then said the Princes vnto Baruch, Go hide thee, thou and Ieremiah, and let no man know where yee bee.
\v 20 ¶ And they went in to the King into the Court, bnt they layed vp the roule in the chamber of Elishama the Scribe, and told all the words in the eares of the king.
\v 21 So the king sent Iehudi to fet the roule, and hee tooke it out of Elishama the scribes chamber, and Iehudi read it in the eares of the king, and in the eares of all the princes which stood beside the king.
\v 22 Now the king sate in the winter house, in the ninth moneth, & \add there was a fire\add* on the hearth burning before him.
\v 23 And it came to passe \add that\add* when Iehudi had read three or foure leaues, he cut \add it\add* with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that \add was\add* on the hearth, vntill all the roule \add was\add* consumed in the fire that was on the hearth.
\v 24 Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, \add neither\add* the king, nor any of his seruants that heard all these words.
\v 25 Neuerthelesse Elnathan, and Delaiah & Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burne the roule, but he would not heare them.
\v 26 \f + \fr 36:26 \ft Or, of the king.\f*But the king commaunded Ierahmeel the sonne of Hammelech, and Seraiah the sonne of Azriel, & Shelennah the sonne of Abdiel, to take Baruch the scribe, and Ieremiah the Prophet: but the \nd LORD\nd* hid them.
\v 27 ¶ Then the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came to Ieremiah (after that the king had burnt the roule and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Ieremiah) saying;
\v 28 Take thee againe another roule, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roule, which Iehoiakim the king of Iudah hath burnt.
\v 29 And thou shalt say to Iehoiakim king of Iudah, Thus sayth the \nd LORD\nd*, Thou hast burnt this roule, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainely come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?
\v 30 \f + \fr 36:30 \ft Chap.22.19.\f*Therefore thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of Iehoiakim king of Iudah; He shall haue none to sit vpon the throne of Dauid, and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heate, and in the night to the frost.
\v 31 \f + \fr 36:31 \ft Heb. visit vpon.\f*And I will punish him and his seede, and his seruants for their iniquitie, and I will bring vpon them, and vpon the inhabitants of Ierusalem, and vpon the men of Iudah all the euill that I haue pronounced against them: but they hearkened not.
\v 32 ¶ \f + \fr 36:32 \ft Heb. as they.\f*Then tooke Ieremiah another roule, and gaue it to Baruch the scribe the sonne of Neriah, who wrote therein from the mouth of Ieremiah, all the words of the booke which Iehoiakim king of Iudah had burnt in the fire, and there were added besides vnto them, many like words.

\v 0 1 The Egyptians hauing raised the siege of the Caldeans, king Zedekiah sendeth to Ieremiah to pray for the people. 6 Ieremiah prophesieth the Caldeans certaine returne and victory. 11 He is taken for a fugitiue, beaten and put in prison. 16 He assureth Zedekiah of the captiuitie. 18 Intreating for his liberty, he obtaineth some fauour.
\v 1 ¶ \f + \fr 37:1 \ft Chap.22.24. 2.kings 24.17. and 2.chron. 36 10.\f*And king Zedekiah the sonne of Iosiah reigned in stead of Coniah the son of Iehoiakim, whō Nebuchad-rezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Iudah.
\v 2 \f + \fr 37:2 \ft Heb. by the hand of the prophet.\f*But neither he, nor his seruants, nor the people of the land, did hearken vnto the words of the \nd LORD\nd*, which he spake by the prophet Ieremiah.
\v 3 And Zedekiah the king sent Iehucal the sonne of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Ieremiah, saying, Pray now vnto the \nd LORD\nd* our God for vs.
\v 4 Nowe Ieremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him into prison.
\v 5 Then Pharaohs armie was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Caldeans that besieged Ierusalem, heard tidings of them, they departed from Ierusalem.
\v 6 ¶ Then came the word of the \nd LORD\nd* vnto the Prophet Ieremiah, saying,
\v 7 Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, the God of Israel, Thus shall ye say to the king of Iudah, that sent you vnto me to enquire of me, Behold, Pharaohs armie which is come forth to helpe you, shall returne to Egypt into their owne land.
\v 8 And the Caldeans shall come againe, and fight against this citie and take it, and burne it with fire.
\v 9 \f + \fr 37:9 \ft Heb. soules\f*Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Deceiue not your selues, saying, The Caldeans shall surely depart from vs: for they shall not depart.
\v 10 \f + \fr 37:10 \ft Heb. thrust through.\f*For though yee had smitten the whole armie of the Caldeans that fight against you, and there remained \add but\add* wounded men among them, \add yet\add* should they rise vp euery man in his tent, and burne this citie with fire.
\v 11 ¶ \f + \fr 37:11 \ft Heb. made to ascend.\f*And it came to passe that when the armie of the Caldeans was broken vp from Ierusalem for feare of Pharaohs armie,
\v 12 \f + \fr 37:12 \ft Or, to slip away from thence in the midst of the people.\f*Then Ieremiah went forth out of Ierusalem to goe into the lande of Beniamin, to separate himselfe thence in the mids of the people.
\v 13 And when he was in the gate of Beniamin, a captaine of the warde \add was\add* there, whose name \add was\add* Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the sonne of Hananiah, & he tooke Ieremiah the Prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the Caldeans
\v 14 \f + \fr 37:14 \ft Heb. falsehood or lie.\f*Then said Ieremiah, \add It is\add* false, I fall not away to the Caldeans: but he hearkened not to him: so Irijah tooke Ieremiah, and brought him to the princes.
\v 15 Wherfore the princes were wroth with Ieremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison, in the house of Ionathan the scribe, for they had made that the prison.
\v 16 ¶ \f + \fr 37:16 \ft Or, Celles.\f*When Ieremiah was entred into the dungeon, and into the cabbins, and Ieremiah had remained there many dayes:
\v 17 Then Zedekiah the king sent and tooke him out, and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there \add any\add* word from the \nd LORD\nd*? and Ieremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be deliuered into the hand of the king of Babylon.
\v 18 Moreouer Ieremiah sayd vnto king Zedekiah, What haue I offended against thee, or against thy seruants, or against this people, that yee haue put me in prison?
\v 19 Where \add are\add* now your prophets, which prophecied vnto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?
\v 20 \f + \fr 37:20 \ft Heb. let my supplication fall.\f*Therefore heare now, I pray thee, O my \nd LORD\nd* the king; let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee, that thou cause me not to returne to the house of Ionathan the scribe, lest I die there.
\v 21 Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Ieremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should giue him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers streete, vntill all the bread in the citie were spent. Thus Ieremiah remained in the court of the prison.
\c 38
\v 0 1 Ieremiah by a false suggestion is put into the dungeon of Malchiah. 7 Ebed-melech, by suite, getteth him some inlargement. 14 Vpon secret conference, he counsaileth the king by yeelding to saue his life. 24 By the kings instructions, he concealeth the conference from the Princes.
\v 1 ¶ Then Shephatiah the sonne of Mattan, and Gedaliah the sonne of Pashur and Iucal the sonne of Shelemiah, & Pashur the sonne of Malchiah heard the words that Ieremiah had spoken vnto all the people, saying,
\v 2 \f + \fr 38:2 \ft Cha.21.9\f*Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, He that remaineth in this citie, shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, but he that goeth forth to the Caldeans, shall liue: for he shall haue his life for a pray, and shall liue.
\v 3 Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, This citie shall surely be giuen into the hand of the king of Babylons armie, which shall take it.
\v 4 \f + \fr 38:4 \ft Heb. peace.\f*Therefore the princes sayd vnto the king, We beseech thee let this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of warre that remaine in this citie, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words vnto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.
\v 5 Then Zedekiah the king sayd, Behold, he \add is\add* in your hand; for the king \add is\add* not \add he that\add* can do \add any\add* thing against you.
\v 6 \f + \fr 38:6 \ft Or, of the king.\f*Then tooke they Ieremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the sonne of Hammelech that \add was\add* in the court of the prison: and they let downe Ieremiah with cords: and in the dungeon \add there was\add* no water, but mire: so Ieremiah sunke in the mire.
\v 7 ¶ Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, one of y\sup e\sup* eunuches which was in the kings house, heard that they had put Ieremiah in the dungeon (the king then sitting in the gate of Beniamin)
\v 8 Ebed-melech went foorth out of the kings house, and spake to the king, saying,
\v 9 \f + \fr 38:9 \ft Hebr. he will die.\f*My lord the king, these men haue done euill in all that they haue done to Ieremiah the Prophet, whom they haue cast into the dungeon, and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is, for \add there is\add* no more bread in the city.
\v 10 \f + \fr 38:10 \ft Hebr. in thine hand.\f*Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirtie men with thee, and take vp Ieremiah the Prophet out of the dungeon before he die.
\v 11 So Ebed-melech tooke the men with him, and went into the house of the king vnder the treasurie, and tooke thence old cast cloutes, and old rotten ragges, and let them downe by cordes into the dungeon to Ieremiah.
\v 12 And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said vnto Ieremiah, Put now \add these\add* old cast cloutes and rotten ragges vnder thine arme-holes, vnder the cordes. And Ieremiah did so.
\v 13 So they drew vp Ieremiah with cordes, and tooke him vp out of the dungeon, and Ieremiah remained in the court of the prison.
\v 14 ¶ \f + \fr 38:14 \ft Or principall.\f*Then Zedekiah the king sent, and tooke Ieremiah the Prophet vnto him into the third entrie that \add is\add* in the house of the \nd LORD\nd*, and the king said vnto Ieremiah, I will aske thee a thing: hide nothing from me.
\v 15 Then Ieremiah said vnto Zedekiah, If I declare \add it\add* vnto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I giue thee counsell, wilt thou not hearken vnto me?
\v 16 So the king sware secretly vnto Ieremiah, saying, As the \nd LORD\nd* liueth that made vs this soule, I wil not put thee to death, neither will I giue thee into the hand of these men that seeke thy life.
\v 17 Then said Ieremiah vnto Zedekiah, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* the God of hostes, the God of Israel, If thou wilt assuredly goe foorth vnto the king of Babylons Princes, then thy soule shall liue, and this Citie shall not be burnt with fire, and thou shalt liue, and thine house.
\v 18 But if thou wilt not goe foorth to the king of Babylons Princes, then shall this City be giuen into the hand of the Caldeans, and they shall burne it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.
\v 19 And Zedekiah the king said vnto Ieremiah, I am afraid of the Iewes that are fallen to the Caldeans, lest they deliuer mee into their hand, and they mocke me.
\v 20 But Ieremiah said, They shall not deliuer \add thee\add*: obey, I beseech thee, the voyce of the \nd LORD\nd*, which I speake vnto thee: so it shall be well vnto thee, and thy soule shall liue.
\v 21 But if thou refuse to goe foorth, this \add is\add* the word that the \nd LORD\nd* hath shewed me.
\v 22 \f + \fr 38:22 \ft Hebr. men of thy peace.\f*And behold, all the women that are left in the king of Iudahs house, \add shalbe\add* brought forth to the king of Babylons Princes, and those \add women\add* shall say, Thy friends haue set thee on, \add and\add* haue preuailed against thee: thy feet are sunke in the mire, and they are turned away backe.
\v 23 \f + \fr 38:23 \ft Hebr. thou shalt burne, &c.\f*So they shall bring out all thy wiues, and thy children to the Caldeans, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the King of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this citie to be burnt with fire.
\v 24 ¶ Then said Zedekiah vnto Ieremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.
\v 25 But if the Princes heare that I haue talked with thee, and they come vnto thee, and say vnto thee, Declare vnto vs now what thou hast said vnto the king; hide it not from vs, and wee wil not put thee to death; also what the king said vnto thee:
\v 26 Then thou shalt say vnto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to returne to Ionathans house to die there.
\v 27 \f + \fr 38:27 \ft Hebr. they were silent from him.\f*Then came all the Princes vnto Ieremiah, and asked him, and he told them according to all these words, that the king had commanded: so they left off speaking with him, for the matter was not perceiued.
\v 28 So Ieremiah abode in the court of the prison, vntill the day that Ierusalem was taken, and hee was \add there\add* when Ierusalem was taken.
\c 39
\v 0 1 Ierusalem is taken. 4 Zedekiah is made blinde, and sent to Babylon. 8 The city ruinated, 9 the people captiuated. 11 Nebuchad-rezzars charge for the good vsage of Ieremiah. 15 Gods promise to Ebed-melech.
\v 1 ¶ \f + \fr 39:1 \ft 2.Kin. 25. 1. chap. 52. 4.\f*In the ninth yeere of Zedekiah king of Iudah, in the tenth moneth, came Nebuchad rezzar king of Babylon, and all his armie against Ierusalem, and they besieged it.
\v 2 \add And\add* in the eleuenth yeere of Zedekiah, in the fourth moneth, the ninth \add day\add* of the moneth, the citie was broken vp.
\v 3 And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sate in the middle gate, \add euen\add* Nergal-Sharezer, Samgar-Nebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergal-Sharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.
\v 4 ¶ And it came to passe, \add that\add* when Zedekiah the king of Iudah saw them and all the men of warre, then they fled and went forth out of the citie by night, by the way of the kings garden, by the gate betwixt the two walles, and hee went out the way of the plaine.
\v 5 \f + \fr 39:5 \ft Hebr. spake with him iudgements.\f*But the Caldeans armie pursued after them, and ouertooke Zedekiah in the plaines of Iericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him vp to Nebuchad-nezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gaue iudgement vpon him.
\v 6 Then the king of Babylon slewe the sonnes of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Iudah.
\v 7 \f + \fr 39:7 \ft Heb. with two brasen chaines, or fetters.\f*Moreouer he put out Zedekiahs eyes, and bound him with chaines, to cary him to Babylon.
\v 8 ¶ And the Caldeans burnt the kings house, and the houses of the people with fire, and brake downe the wals of Ierusalem.
\v 9 \f + \fr 39:9 \ft Or, chiefe Marshall. Hebr. chiefe of the executioners or slaughter men.

\v 10 \f + \fr 39:10 \ft Hebr. in that day.\f*But Nebuzaradan the captaine of the guard left of the poore of the people which had nothing, in the land of Iudah, and gaue them vineyards and fieldes at the same time.

\v 13 So Nebuzaradan the captaine of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, and Nergal-Sharezer, Rabmag, and all the King of Babylons Princes:
\v 14 Euen they sent, and tooke Ieremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him vnto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the sonne of Shaphan, that hee should carie him home: so hee dwelt among the people.
\v 15 ¶ Now the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came vnto Ieremiah, while hee was shut vp in the court of the prison, saying;
\v 16 Goe and speake to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus sayth the \nd LORD\nd* of hostes the God of Israel, Behold, I will bring my words vpon this citie for euill, and not for good, and they shall be \add accomplished\add* in that day before thee.

\v 0 1 Ieremiah being set free by Nebuzaradan, goeth to Gedaliah. 7 The dispersed Iewes repaire vnto him. 13 Iohanan reuealing Ishmaels conspiracie, is not beleeued.
\v 1 ¶ \f + \fr 40:1 \ft Or, manicles.\f*The word which came to Ieremiah frō the \nd LORD\nd* after that Nebuzaradan the captaine of the guard had let him goe from Ramath, when hee had taken him being bound in chaines among all that were caried away captiue of Ierusalem and Iudah, which were caried away captiue vnto Babylon.
\v 2 And the captaine of the gard took Ieremiah, and sayd vnto him, The \nd LORD\nd* thy God hath pronounced this euill vpon this place.
\v 3 Now the \nd LORD\nd* hath brought \add it\add*, and done according as he hath sayd: because yee haue sinned against the \nd LORD\nd*, and haue not obeyed his voyce, therefore this thing is come vpon you.
\v 4 \f + \fr 40:4 \ft Heb. I will set mine eye vpon thee.\f*And now behold, I loose thee this day from the chaines which \add were\add* vpon thine hand: if it seeme good vnto thee to come with me into Babylon, come, and I will looke well vnto thee: but if it seeme ill vnto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbeare: behold, all the land \add is\add* before thee: whither it seemeth good and conuenient for thee to goe, thither goe.
\v 5 Now while he was not yet gone backe, he sayd, Goe backe also to Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam the sonne of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made gouernour ouer all the cities of Iudah, and dwell with him among the people: or goe wheresoeuer it seemeth conuenient vnto thee to goe. So the captaine of the gard gaue him vitailes and a reward, and let him goe.
\v 6 Then went Ieremiah vnto Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam to Mizpah, and dwelt with him among the people, that were left in the land.
\v 7 ¶ Now when all the captaines of the forces which \add were\add* in the fields, \add euen\add* they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam gouernour in the land, and had committed vnto him men, and women and children, and of the poore of the land, of them that were not caried away captiue to Babylon;
\v 8 Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, euen Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah, and Iohanan, and Ionathan the sonnes of Kareah, and Seraiah the sonne of Tanhumeth, and the sonnes of Ephai the Netophathite, and Iezaniah the sonne of a Maachathite, they and their men.
\v 9 \f + \fr 40:9 \ft Heb. to stand before. And so verse.10.\f*And Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam the sonne of Shaphan, sware vnto them and to their men, saying, Feare not to serue the Caldeans: dwell in the land and serue the king of Babylon, and it shalbe well with you.
\v 10 As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah to serue the Caldeans, which will come vnto vs: but yee, gather yee wine, and summer fruits, and oyle, and put \add them\add* in your vessels, and dwell in your cities, that yee haue taken.
\v 11 Likewise when all the Iewes that \add were\add* in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that \add were\add* in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Iudah, and that he had set ouer them Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam the sonne of Shaphan;
\v 12 Euen all the Iewes returned out of all places whither they were driuen, and came to the land of Iudah, to Gedaliah vnto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits, very much.
\v 13 ¶ Moreouer Iohanan the sonne of Kareah, and all the captaines of the forces that \add were\add* in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,
\v 14 \f + \fr 40:14 \ft Heb. to strike thee in soule?\f*And sayd vnto him, Doest thou certainly know, that Baalis the king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah to slay thee? But Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam beleeued them not.
\v 15 Then Iohanan the sonne of Kareah, spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me goe, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah, and no man shall know \add it\add*. Wherefore should he slay thee, that all the Iewes which are gathered vnto thee should be scattered, and the remnant in Iudah perish?
\v 16 But Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam sayd vnto Iohanan the sonne of Kareah; Thou shalt not do this thing, for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael.
\c 41
\v 0 1 Ishmael, trecherously killing Gedaliah and others, purposeth with the residue to flie vnto the Ammonites. 11 Iohanan recouereth the captiues, and mindeth to fly into Egypt.
\v 1 ¶ Now it came to passe in the seuenth moneth, \add that\add* Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah the sonne of Elishamah of the seede royall, and the princes of the king, euen tenne men with him, came vnto Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam to Mizpah, and there they did eate bread together in Mizpah.
\v 2 Then arose Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the sonne of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whome the king of Babylon had made gouernour ouer the land.
\v 3 Ishmael also slew all the Iewes that were with him, \add euen\add* with Gedaliah at Mizpah, \add and\add* the Caldeans that were found there, and the men of warre.
\v 4 And it came to passe the second day after he had slaine Gedaliah, and no man knew \add it\add*,
\v 5 That there came certaine from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, \add euen\add* fourescore men, hauing their beards shauen, and their clothes rent, and hauing cut themselues, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring \add them\add* to the house of the \nd LORD\nd*.
\v 6 \f + \fr 41:6 \ft Heb. in going and weeping.\f*And Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah went foorth from Mizpah to meete them, weeping all along as hee went: and it came to passe as hee met them, he said vnto them, Come to Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam.
\v 7 And it was \add so\add* when they came into the midst of the citie, that Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah slew them, \add and cast them\add* into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that \add were\add* with him.
\v 8 But ten men were found among them, that said vnto Ishmael, Slay vs not: for we haue treasures in the field, of wheate, and of barley, and of oyle, and of hony: so he forbare, and slewe them not among their brethren.
\v 9 \f + \fr 41:9 \ft Or, neere Gedaliah, heb. by the hand or by the side of Gedaliah.\f*Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men (whom he had slaine because of Gedaliah) \add was\add* it, which Asa the king had made, for feare of Baasha king of Israel, \add and\add* Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah filled it with \add them that were\add* slaine.
\v 10 Then Ishmael caried away captiue all the residue of the people, that \add were\add* in Mizpah, \add euen\add* the kings daughters, and al the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captaine of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam, and Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah caried them away captiue, and departed to goe ouer to the Ammonites.
\v 11 ¶ But when Iohanan the sonne of Kareah, and all the captaines of the forces that \add were\add* with him, heard of all the euill that Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah had done,
\v 12 Then they tooke all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that \add are\add* in Gibeon.
\v 13 Now it came to passe \add that\add* when al the people which \add were\add* with Ishmael, sawe Iohanan the sonne of Kareah, and all the captaines of the forces, that \add were\add* with him, then they were glad.
\v 14 So all the people that Ishmael had caried away captiue from Mizpah cast about and returned, and went vnto Iohanan the sonne of Kareah.
\v 15 But Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah escaped from Iohanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites.
\v 16 Then tooke Iohanan the sonne of Kareah, and all the captaines of the forces that \add were\add* with him, all the remnant of the people whom he had recouered from Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah, from Mizpah (after \add that\add* he had slaine Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam,) \add euen\add* mighty men of warre, and the women, and the children, and the eunuches whom he had brought againe from Gibeon.
\v 17 And they departed and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to goe to enter into Egypt,
\v 18 Because of the Caldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the sonne of Nethaniah had slaine Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made gouernour in the land.
\c 42
\v 0 1 Iohanan desireth Ieremiah to enquire of God, promising obedience to his will. 7 Ieremiah assureth him of safety in Iudea, 13 and destruction in Egypt. 19 He reproueth their hypocrisie in requiring of the \nd LORD\nd*, that which they meant not.
\v 1 ¶ Then all the captaines of the forces, and Iohanan the sonne of Kareah, and Iezaniah the sonne of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least euen vnto the greatest, came neere,
\v 2 \f + \fr 42:2 \ft Or, let our supplication fall before thee.\f*And said vnto Ieremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for vs vnto the \nd LORD\nd* thy God, \add euen\add* for all this remnant (for we are left \add but\add* a few of many, as thine eies do behold vs)
\v 3 That the \nd LORD\nd* thy God may shew vs the way wherein we may walke, and the thing that we may doe.
\v 4 Then Ieremiah the prophet sayd vnto them, I haue heard \add you\add*; behold, I will pray vnto the \nd LORD\nd* your God, according to your words, and it shall come to passe \add that\add* whatsoeuer thing the \nd LORD\nd* shall answere you, I will declare \add it\add* vnto you: I will keepe nothing backe from you.
\v 5 Then they sayd to Ieremiah, The \nd LORD\nd* be a true and faithfull witnesse betweene vs, if we doe not, euen according to all things for the which the \nd LORD\nd* thy God shall send thee to vs.
\v 6 Whether \add it be\add* good, or whether \add it be\add* euill, we will obey the voice of the \nd LORD\nd* our God, to whom we send thee, that it may be well with vs, when we obey the voice of the \nd LORD\nd* our God.
\v 7 ¶ And it came to passe after tenne dayes, that the word of the \nd LORD\nd* came vnto Ieremiah.
\v 8 Then called hee Iohanan the sonne of Kareah, and all the captaines of the forces which \add were\add* with him, and all the people, from the least, euen to the greatest,
\v 9 And said vnto them, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, the God of Israel, vnto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him:
\v 10 If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull \add you\add* downe, and I will plant \add you\add*, and not plucke you vp: for I repent mee of the euill, that I haue done vnto you.
\v 11 Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom yee are afraid: be not afraid of him, saith the \nd LORD\nd*: for I \add am\add* with you to saue you, and to deliuer you from his hand.
\v 12 And I will shew mercies vnto you, that he may haue mercy vpon you; and cause you to returne to your owne land.
\v 13 ¶ But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of the \nd LORD\nd* your God,
\v 14 Saying, No, but we will goe into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no warre, nor heare the sound of the Trumpet, nor haue hunger of bread, and there will we dwell:
\v 15 (And now therefore heare the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, yee remnant of Iudah, Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hostes the God of Israel, If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt, and goe to soiourne there:)
\v 16 \f + \fr 42:16 \ft Hebr. shall cleaue after you.\f*Then it shall come to passe, \add that\add* the sword which yee feared, shall ouertake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine whereof yee were afraid, shall follow close after you in Egypt, and there ye shall die.
\v 17 \f + \fr 42:17 \ft Hebr. so shall all the men be.\f*So shall it bee with all the men that set their faces to goe into Egypt to soiourne there, they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall remaine or escape from the euil that I will bring vpon them.
\v 18 For thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts the God of Israel, As mine anger and my furie hath bene powred foorth vpon the inhabitants of Ierusalem: so shall my furie bee powred foorth vpon you, when yee shall enter into Egypt: and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproch, and ye shall see this place no more.
\v 19 ¶ \f + \fr 42:19 \ft Hebr. testified against you.\f*The \nd LORD\nd* hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Iudah, Goe ye not into Egypt: know certainly, that I haue admonished you this day.
\v 20 \f + \fr 42:20 \ft Or, you haue vsed deceit against your soules.\f*For ye dissembled in your hearts when ye sent me vnto the \nd LORD\nd* your God, saying, Pray for vs vnto the \nd LORD\nd* our God, and according vnto all that the \nd LORD\nd* our God shall say, so declare vnto vs, and we wil doe \add it\add*.
\v 21 And \add now\add* I haue this day declared \add it\add* to you, but ye haue not obeied the voice of the \nd LORD\nd* your God, nor any \add thing\add* for the which he hath sent me vnto you.
\v 22 Now therefore know certainly, that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go \add and\add* to soiourne.
\c 43
\v 0 1 Iohanan, discrediting Ieremiahs prophecie, carieth Ieremiah and others into Egypt. 8 Ieremiah prophecieth by a type the conquest of Egypt, by the Babylonians.
\v 1 ¶ And it came to passe that whē Ieremiah had made an end of speaking vnto all the people, al the words of the \nd LORD\nd* their God, for which the \nd LORD\nd* their God had sent him to them, euen all these words;
\v 2 Then spake Azariah the sonne of Hoshaiah, and Iohanan the sonne of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying vnto Ieremiah, Thou speakest falsly: the \nd LORD\nd* our God hath not sent thee to say, Goe not into Egypt, to soiourne there.
\v 3 But Baruch the sonne of Neriah setteth thee on against vs, for to deliuer vs into the hand of the Caldeans, that they might put vs to death, and carie vs away captiues into Babylon.
\v 4 So Iohanan the sonne of Kareah, and all the captaines of the forces, and all the people, obeied not the voice of the \nd LORD\nd*, to dwell in the land of Iudah.
\v 5 But Iohanan the sonne of Kareah, and all the captaines of the forces, tooke all the remnant of Iudah, that were returned from all nations whither they had bene driuen, to dwell in the land of Iudah,
\v 6 Euen men, and women, and children, and the kings daughters, and euery person that Nebuzaradan the captaine of the guard had left with Gedaliah the sonne of Ahikam, the sonne of Shaphan, and Ieremiah the Prophet, and Baruch the sonne of Neriah.
\v 7 So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voyce of the \nd LORD\nd*, thus came they \add euen\add* to Tahpanhes.
\v 8 ¶ Then came the word of the \nd LORD\nd* vnto Ieremiah in Tahpanhes, saying;
\v 9 Take great stones in thine hand, and hide them in the clay in the bricke kill, which \add is\add* at the entry of Pharaohs house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Iudah:
\v 10 And say vnto them, Thus saieth the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts the God of Israel; Beholde, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon my seruant, and will set his throne vpon these stones that I haue hidde, and hee shall spread his royall pauilion ouer them.
\v 11 \f + \fr 43:11 \ft Chap.15.2 zach.11.2.\f*And when he commeth, hee shall smite the land of Egypt, \add and deliuer\add* such \add as are\add* for death, to death; and such \add as are\add* for captiuitie to captiuitie; and such \add as are\add* for the sword, to the sword.
\v 12 And I wil kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt, and hee shall burne them, and carry them away captiues, and hee shall aray himselfe with the land of Egypt, as a shepheard putteth on his garment, and hee shall goe forth from thence in peace.
\v 13 \f + \fr 43:13 \ft Heb. statues, or standing images.\f*\f + \fr 43:13 \ft Or, The house of the Sunne.\f*He shall breake also the images of Beth-shemesh that \add is\add* in the land of Egypt, and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burne with fire.

\v 0 1 Ieremiah expresseth the desolation of Iudah for their idolatry. 11 Hee prophesieth their destruction, who commit idolatry in Egypt. 15 The obstinacie of the Iewes. 20 Ieremiah threatneth them for the same, 29 And for a signe, prophecieth the destruction of Egypt.
\v 1 ¶ The word that came to Ieremiah concerning all the Iewes which dwel in the land of Egypt, which dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the countrey of Pathros, saying,
\v 2 Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye haue seene all the euill that I haue brought vpon Ierusalem, and vpon all the cities of Iudah: and behold, this day they \add are\add* a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein,
\v 3 Because of their wickednes which they haue committed, to prouoke me to anger, in that they went to burne incense, \add and\add* to serue other gods, whom they knew not, \add neither\add* they, you, nor your fathers.
\v 4 Howbeit I sent vnto you all my seruants the Prophets, rising early and sending \add them\add*, saying, Oh doe not this abominable thing that I hate.
\v 5 But they hearkened not, nor enclined their eare to turne from their wickednes, to burne no incense vnto other gods.
\v 6 Wherefore my furie and mine anger was powred forth, and was kindled in the cities of Iudah, and in the streets of Ierusalem, and they are wasted \add and\add* desolate, as at this day.
\v 7 \f + \fr 44:7 \ft Hebr. out of the midst of Iudah.\f*Therefore now thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* the God of hostes, the God of Israel, Wherefore commit ye \add this\add* great euill against your soules, to cut off from you man and woman, childe and suckling out of Iudah, to leaue you none to remaine.
\v 8 In that yee prouoke mee vnto wrath with the workes of your hands, burning incense vnto other gods in the land of Egypt whither ye bee gone to dwell, that yee might cut your selues off, and that ye might be a curse, and a reproch among all the nations of the earth?
\v 9 \f + \fr 44:9 \ft Heb. wickednesses, or, punishments &c.\f*Haue ye forgotten the wickednes of your fathers, and the wickednesse of the kings of Iudah, and the wickednes of their wiues, and your owne wickednesse, and the wickednesse of your wiues, which they haue committed in the land of Iudah, and in the streets of Ierusalem?
\v 10 \f + \fr 44:10 \ft Hebr. contrite.\f*They are not humbled \add euen\add* vnto this day, neither haue they feared, nor walked in my Law, nor in my Statutes that I set before you, and before your fathers.
\v 11 ¶ \f + \fr 44:11 \ft Amos 9.4.\f*Therefore thus sayeth the \nd LORD\nd* of hostes, the God of Israel, Behold, I will set my face against you for euill, and to cut off all Iudah.
\v 12 And I will take the remnant of Iudah, that haue set their faces to goe into the land of Egypt to soiourne there, and they shall all be consumed \add and\add* fall in the land of Egypt: they shall \add euen\add* bee consumed by the sword, \add and\add* by the famine: they shall die, from the least euen vnto the greatest, by the sword \add and\add* by the famine: and they shalbe an execration and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproch.
\v 13 For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I haue punished Ierusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence;
\v 14 \f + \fr 44:14 \ft Heb. lift vp their soule.\f*So that none of the remnant of Iudah which are gone into the land of Egypt to soiourne there, shall escape or remaine, that they should returne into the land of Iudah to the which they haue a desire to returne to dwell there: for none shall returne but such as shall escape.
\v 15 ¶ Then all the men which knew that their wiues had burnt incense vnto other Gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, euen all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt in Pathros, answered Ieremiah, saying,
\v 16 \add As for\add* the word that thou hast spoken vnto vs in the name of the \nd LORD\nd*, we will not hearken vnto thee.
\v 17 \f + \fr 44:17 \ft Or, frame of heauen.\f*\f + \fr 44:17 \ft Chap. 7. 18.\f*\f + \fr 44:17 \ft Heb. bread.\f*But we will certainly doe whatsoeuer thing goeth forth out of our owne mouth, to burne incense vnto the queene of heauen, and to powre out drinke offrings vnto her, as we haue done, we and our fathers, our kings and our princes in the cities of Iudah, and in the streetes of Ierusalem: for \add then\add* had we plentie of vitailes, and were well, and saw no euill.
\v 18 But since we left off to burne incense to the queene of heauen, and to powre out drinke offrings vnto her, we haue wanted all \add things\add*, and haue beene consumed by the sword, and by the famine.
\v 19 \f + \fr 44:19 \ft Chap.7. 18.\f*\f + \fr 44:19 \ft Or, husbands.\f*And when we burnt incense to the queene of heauen, and powred out drinke offrings vnto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and powre out drinke offrings vnto her without our men?
\v 20 ¶ Then Ieremiah sayd vnto all the people, to the men and to the women, and to all the people which had giuen him \add that\add* answere, saying;
\v 21 The incense that yee burnt in the cities of Iudah, and in the streetes of Ierusalem, yee and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the \nd LORD\nd* remember them, and came it \add not\add* into his minde?
\v 22 So that the \nd LORD\nd* could no longer beare, because of the euill of your doings, \add and\add* because of the abominations, which yee haue committed: therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse without an inhabitant, as at this day.
\v 23 Because you haue burnt incense, and because yee haue sinned against the \nd LORD\nd*, and haue not obeyed the voyce of the \nd LORD\nd*, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies: therefore this euill is happened vnto you, as at this day.
\v 24 Moreouer Ieremiah sayd vnto all the people, and to all the women; Heare the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, all Iudah, that \add are\add* in the land of Egypt.
\v 25 Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd* of hostes the God of Israel, saying: Yee and your wiues haue both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying; We will surely performe our vowes that we haue vowed, to burne incense to the queene of heauen, and to powre out drinke offrings vnto her: yee will surely accomplish your vowes, and surely performe your vowes.
\v 26 Therefore heare yee the word of the \nd LORD\nd*, all Iudah that dwell in the land of Egypt, Behold, I haue sworne by my great Name, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, that my Name shal no more be named in the mouth of any man of Iudah, in all the land of Egypt, saying, The \nd LORD\nd* God liueth.
\v 27 Behold, I will watch ouer them for euill, and not for good, and all the men of Iudah that \add are\add* in the land of Egypt shalbe consumed by the sword, & by the famin, vntil there be an end of them.
\v 28 \f + \fr 44:28 \ft Heb. from me or from them.\f*Yet a small number that escape the sword, shall returne out of the land of Egypt into the land of Iudah: and all the remnant of Iudah that are gone into the land of Egypt to soiourne there, shall know whose wordes shall stand, mine or theirs.
\v 29 ¶ And this \add shalbe\add* a signe vnto you, saith the \nd LORD\nd*, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may knowe that my words shal surely stand against you for euill.
\v 30 Thus saith the \nd LORD\nd*, Behold, I will giue Pharaoh-Hophra king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hande of them that seeke his life, as I gaue Zedekiah king of Iudah into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon his enemy, and that sought his life.

\v 0 1 Baruch being dismayed, 4 Ieremiah instructeth and comforteth him.
\v 1 ¶ The word that Ieremiah the Prophet spake vnto Baruch the sonne of Neriah, when he had written these words in a booke at the mouth of Ieremiah, in the fourth yeere of Iehoiakim the sonne of Iosiah king of Iudah, saying,
