# Open Bible Data

Code and datasets for the OpenBibleData project

This consists of two main components:

1. Some public domain or open-licenced Bible source files copied from other sites
2. Python code to generate a static website from the various Bible file sets

The copied Bibles are not committed yet.

The preliminary static website can currently be viewed at [[https://OpenEnglishTranslation.Bible/]] at the <em>Reader</em> link.
